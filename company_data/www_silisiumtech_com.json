    "description": "SilisiumTech, Inc. is a Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) spinoff who\u2019s mission is to rebuild and decarbonize the US Solar supply chain. Last year the solar industry shrunk by 16% because of the dependencies on China where 97% of all silicon wafers are produced; tariffs, circumvention of the tariffs, and forced labor practices have created a volatile industry.  Our inventor and CTO has been working on this problem for the last 10 years with $5M in grant funding from DOE, NSF, and others.  He has developed a process to make silicon wafers on a continual bases which will cut the cost of today\u2019s manually produced wafers in half and produce half as much CO2 - if all silicon wafers were produced with this continuous process, we would prevent 1,420 metric tons of GHG from being produced annually. This work led to SilisiumTech winning Rounds 1 and 2 in the DOE Made in America Solar Prize, generated two patents, being accepted into the Gener8tor Sustainability accelerator, and winning a spot in the Clean Tech Open.",

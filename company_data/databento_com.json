Here's why. \u2b07\ufe0f  \n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 \ud83d\udce2 SEC Proposes Rule to Enhance Competition for Individual Investor Order Execution (https://lnkd.in/gD9uq3-T)\n\n> [...] the proposed rule generally would prohibit a \u201crestricted competition trading center\u201d such as a wholesaler from internally executing \u201csegmented orders\u201d [...] unless the orders are first exposed to competition in a \u201cqualified auction\u201d operated by an \u201copen competition trading center.\u201d\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 \ud83d\udce2 SEC Proposes Rules to Amend Minimum Pricing Increments and Access Fee Caps and to Enhance the Transparency of Better Priced Orders (https://lnkd.in/gE9NdTGy)\n\n> the Commission proposed to amend Rule 612 of Regulation NMS to establish variable minimum pricing increments for quotations and orders in NMS stocks that are priced at, or greater than, $1.00 per share [...]\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 \ud83d\udce2 SEC Proposes Amendments to Enhance Disclosure of Order Execution Information (https://lnkd.in/ggdQtPNm) \n\n>  [The] proposal would modify the definition of \u201ccovered order\u201d to include certain orders submitted outside of regular trading hours and certain orders submitted with stop prices. \n\n> The proposed amendments [...] would require the reporting of execution quality information for fractional share orders, odd-lot orders, and larger-sized orders.\n\nThese changes will drive more orders to lit markets, allowing exchanges to compete more on pricing and display sub-penny prices. Databento advocates for fairer, more transparent markets, and largely supports these proposed changes.\n\n#trading #SEC #regulation #finance #stocks #markets #investing",

I don't know of anyone else doing this, especially at this price.\n\n2. The documentation is impressive. From the tutorials, the examples, and the knowledge base, I\u2019ve learned a few things from reading the documentation that I didn\u2019t know in the past.\n\n3. The roadmap is great, and I love to see the team actively working on it. I like the visibility it provides and knowing what\u2019s in the works so that I can plan for my own integrations.

You can now access our data through OpenBB Terminal v2.5.0 and onwards: \u27a1\ufe0f https://to.dbn.to/openBB\n\nAt this time, a wide range of futures symbols on OpenBB are exclusively available through Databento's historical API, which exposes nearly 150,000 futures symbols and 540,000 symbols across options on futures, multi-leg instruments, and user-defined instruments.\n\nDatabento was selected as an OpenBB data provider for our ease of integration (multi-language support, including a Python client library), self-service onboarding, and usage-based pricing. We\u2019ll be providing institutional-grade US equities and futures data direct from the source, as well as options and live data upon release. Users can import their own datasets into OpenBB, and Databento\u2019s data is available for as little as $0.45 per gigabyte.\n\nOpenBB\u2019s terminal product is designed to democratize investment research \u2013 just as Databento is democratizing access to market data. We\u2019re excited to power an analytics solution with a shared mission!\n\n#OpenBB #Python #marketdata #dataanalysis #investmentresearch #fintech",

            "description": "Bringing a remote team together from across six global time zones is no small feat. Here are five takeaways from our #SaltLakeCity off-site on how to run an effective in-person meeting for your remote team:\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Communicate policies in a centralized place.\n\nWe keep a single off-site policy doc which addresses common questions (reimbursements, working hours, etc.) for all off-sites and one supplementary Google spreadsheet for each off-site. A well-crafted, centralized policy doc makes it easy to kick off each subsequent off-site. Combined with a dedicated Slack channel and a primary point-of-contact for each off-site, we ensured everyone knew where to go to for info.\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Prepare a meeting agenda and schedule well in advance. \n\nWe shared all meeting plans in the off-site spreadsheet during the early stages of planning and made scheduling activities a collaborative, crowdsourced effort for the team. This allowed smaller divisions of our team (product, engineering, systems, etc.) to ensure meeting topics had more focus and relevance.\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Plan for a large buffer of \"flex\" hours. \n\nIt's tempting to fill the schedule with meetings but, often, most of the productive work takes place during ad hoc discussions. We found that the best balance was struck by allocating mornings to pre-arranged meetings (briefings, planning sessions, etc.) and leaving afternoon blocks open for a myriad of smaller tasks that manifest during the week.\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 Establish a few common traditions for each off-site.\n\nOne of our most successful, long-running exercises during these off-sites is a companywide \"bug hunt\", where we randomly form groups of four to compete for the most bugs discovered. (Many inside jokes have spun out of these bug hunts!) We've also made it a common practice to end each off-site with a retro session to reflect on what went well and how to make the next off-site better.\n\nHaving a few customs gives old-timers something to look forward to and reminisce with newer employees, and creates continuity in the company culture.\n\n5\ufe0f\u20e3 Explore what the city has to offer. \n\nSLC was a new destination for many, and we took advantage of our mountain setting by incorporating more optional activities such as bouldering and skiing.\n\n#remoteteams #startups #offsites #teambuilding #fintech",

            "reshared_post_description": "#HFT\u00a0strategy time, part 3: Strategy parameters and considerations. \nContinuing my HFT / quant example, see comments for context and disclaimers. \n\nA simple rule-based strategy is to buy a minimum quantity (1 lot) when the skew is highly positive and sell a minimum quantity when the skew is highly negative. Since this should be symmetric, we can introduce a single parameter k to decide when we\u2019d buy or sell: \n\nskew > k \u2192 Buy 1 lot\u00a0          (1\ufe0f\u20e3) \nskew < \u2212k \u2192 Sell 1 lot\u00a0        (2\ufe0f\u20e3) \n\nOn minimum order quantity: \nNote that the minimum quantity depends on the trading platform or market that you\u2019re on. In institutional FX markets, this can be anywhere from $40,000 to $1M. In futures markets, this is usually 1 contract. In equities markets, this is often 100 shares but can even be 1 share or a fractional share. \n\nPosition, order and risk management: \nThis strategy is nice because you don\u2019t have to worry about complex order and position state management. You just let it build up whatever position you want. Because we expect buys and sells to be symmetrically distributed, you will eventually get out of position. However, realistically speaking, you might not have enough margin to build up temporarily large positions, so we have to specify an arbitrary position limit. \n\nskew > k and abs(pos) < 10 lots \u2192 Buy 1 lot\u00a0\u00a0           (3\ufe0f\u20e3) \nskew < \u2212k and abs(pos) < 10 lots \u2192 Sell 1 lot\u00a0          (4\ufe0f\u20e3) \n\nSpoofing: \nOne problem with the skew is that extreme values might be spoofed sometimes, or it\u2019s a well-known feature the price will go the other way because a big trader or algorithm deliberately moves against the direction of skew or imbalance. So we\u2019ll can modify the above and introduce a parameter L to tell us to ignore the skew when it\u2019s too large: \n\nskew > k and abs(skew) < L and abs(pos) < 10 lots \u2192 Buy 1 lot\u00a0      (5\ufe0f\u20e3)\nskew < \u2212k and abs(skew) < L and abs(pos) < 10 lots \u2192 Sell 1 lot\u00a0    (6\ufe0f\u20e3)\n\nNext week I'll talk about overfitting + why I chose the skew function, and then we'll go into strategy implementation. Please read disclaimers below. \n\n(Given the effort it takes to write this out, I think I've earned the right to give a shoutout to my company here. You can get real-time, full order-book data from Databento to calculate these functions.)",

            "reshared_post_description": "Excited to see that PEP 703 will be accepted by the Python Steering Council. Removing the GIL will avail much easier ways to write concurrent and performant code and also change the way people look at Python for quant trading.\n\nOne of the most popular beginner questions in quant finance has always been: \"Which programming language should I learn?\" Python will inevitably be mentioned, along with other popular languages like C++, C#, Java. And for many years, the main comeback for why you can't get by with only Python experience is because of the performance limitations of Python's interpreter, where the GIL practically reduces multithreaded code to single-threaded performance.\n\nAnother complaint used to be the challenge of maintaining a large project in a dynamically-typed language. I feel this is rooted in myths from the pre-type hint past. The longevity of large Python codebases like those at Instagram, Dropbox, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft, Bloomberg have long shown that it's possible to scale a Python codebase, with the help from static analysis tools like mypy, but also by compensating for the lack of static typing with expressive code and established testing practices.\n\nToday, I think it's perfectly fine to be in systematic trading even if you only know Python. The language has made massive strides in performance in the last couple of years. Part of the credit goes to the Faster CPython team\u2014see their talk at PyCon if you haven't. But we've also seen an uptick of modern projects start to take advantage of Rust FFIs and Rust in general, like Ruff, Pydantic V2, Polars, and even Databento's historical and live APIs for market data\u2014which I've worked on for the past year with some of the best engineers I've ever met in my career.\n\n#python #optimization #concurrency #quantfinance #trading #algotrading",

See comments to catch up on this series. \n\nWhy skew for this example?\u00a0\n\u27a1\ufe0f It uses order book data. Many (but not all) HFT strategies use order book data b/c it\u2019s almost like a third dimension, revealing more about the markets than top-of-book data.\u00a0\n\u27a1\ufe0f It\u2019s applicable to both low- and high- frequency strategies.\u00a0\n\u27a1\ufe0f It\u2019s rule-based and easy to understand.\u00a0\n(Opinion: If you use a quant trading platform, go for the one w/order book data.) \n\nInitial implementation:\u00a0\nYou can test various numbers for k and L to observe what happens. \n\nOn overfitting:\u00a0\nNotice that I could\u2019ve introduced 2 different parameters to ignore extremely (+) vs. (-) values of skew differently. However, we only introduced one L b/c you\u2019d expect there to be symmetry. (This isn't always the case, some markets tend to be trending in one direction for a long time & it may make sense to calibrate the 2 parameters differently.)\n\nAlso notice that I don\u2019t have to trade only 1 lot at a time. This can be replaced with a free parameter that you can tweak with optimization. Some strategies work well with small quantities, others with larger quantities. This is partly related with something we call the capacity of a strategy. \n\nStrategies like this that trade very frequently tend to have lower capacity.\nIt\u2019s usually easier to start small then scale it up if it is working, vs. globally optimizing a large number of free parameters. We want to keep the # of parameters as small as possible because of something called overfitting. \n\nAdditional rules:\u00a0\nAdditional rules may improve our strategy. For example, let\u2019s say we want to only buy when price is at least 1 standard deviation above and below recent history. Recent history can be something arbitrary, let\u2019s say 30 minutes as it would capture around 5-10% daily volume, which is around the time you might expect a regime change. This takes advantage of something called mean reversion. \n\nAvoid the temptation to introduce free parameters for the configuration of the bands. I can artificially get very good backtest results by making the SD & lookback period free parameters and optimizing them. It may look good in a backtest, but I guarantee you the strategy will perform poorly out of sample. \n\nAnother way to formulate this additional rule is to only buy after a price downtick or only sell after a price uptick. (I prefer this over technical indicators like Bollinger bands.) This focuses on a different form of mean reversion that\u2019s sometimes called bid-ask bounce. Or more specifically, it\u2019s taking advantage of the stylized fact that there tends to be strong negative autocorrelation between 1 tick price changes on all FIFO markets like spot FX & equities. \n\nNext week is on optimization. Read disclaimers below. \n\n(You can get real-time, full order-book data from Databento to calculate these functions.)",

            "description": "Most people should stop writing RESTful APIs for financial data.\n\nI think this trend is driven by three reasons:\n1. Many newer fintech firms were inspired by the crypto exchange wave and just copied these crypto exchanges' REST APIs blindly, without having seen best practices in mature asset classes.\n2. There's a lot of tooling, standards, and support around RESTful APIs, with OpenAPI/Swagger, Redoc, etc. so it's an easy default.\n3. There are many high quality, openly-documented web APIs based on REST, like Stripe and Twilio SMS, so it's easy to copy them blindly too.\n\nFolks on Databento's API team, myself included, have worked with many internal APIs at top trading firms and proprietary vendor APIs, and we've rarely seen RESTful APIs in use aside from powering simple dashboards or click-trading interfaces.\n\nREST at its core is about manipulating entities. For example, a use case that's mostly\u00a0CRUD on elementary resources, like a dashboard backend API for adding users, deleting them etc., is a very good fit for REST.\n\nIdiomatic REST APIs avoid verbs in their endpoint paths as HTTP verbs like GET are sufficiently expressive for basic CRUD operations. But more abstract mutations like subsampling, space, merging\u2014which are essential in electronic trading\u2014are hard to express in this manner.\n\nIn the words of my colleague Renan Gemignani: once you start doing things involving multiple resources (e.g. datasets, venues, symbology type, schemas, formats, symbols) at once and across multiple domains (e.g. resolve symbols, fetch this range and merge these CUSIPs and then submit this batch job with output symbols remapped to native exchange IDs), your REST endpoints become either unnecessarily complicated, too rigid, or unexpressive.\n\nIt's awkward to force entities like schemas (top-of-book, MBO, OHLCV, etc.), symbols, dates, etc. to become resource-oriented. Neither do they really behave as simple sorts and filters that typically get treated as query parameters under RESTful convention.\n\nWhat are some indirect symptoms of your vendor fighting REST conventions? I've seen several, e.g. \n- Their API forces you to query 1 symbol or 1 date at a time.\n- Their API has a much larger API surface than a raw feed's wire protocol. \n- Their API introduces nearly duplicate interfaces to deal with different asset classes or multi-symbol and full-venue scenarios.\n- Their API has a disorderly, deeply-nested structure of URL parameters.\n- It's unpredictable how more abstract mutations like subsampling, space, merging are expressed.\n\nIn our case, we opted for a more flexible, RPC-style HTTP API. A good HTTP API doesn't have to be RESTful. Slack's API is a great example of a HTTP API that isn't\u2014it's based on a JSON RPC style instead. gRPC has a fallback protocol based on protobufs over HTTP.\n\nThe end result is an API with a small surface of orthogonal methods and very little overlap between them.\n\n#restapi #http #apis #marketdata #algotrading #crypto",

            "reshared_post_description": "\u201cHow do you break into HFT or quant trading?\u201d You\u2019re not gonna like my answer but here goes nothing: \n\nThere\u2019s only ~20 \u201clarge\u201d HFT firms out there that employ over 500 people. Most of these employees don\u2019t do HFT, but serve in supporting roles or on non-HFT teams. Some firms have a 1:1 ratio of legal/compliance folks to quant researchers. \n\nGiven that these firms receive thousands of resumes each week, here\u2019s my candid advice in chronological order: \n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Go to an elite college and study CS, math, or physics. CS > DS. DS is just an easier, less-organized CS as most schools.\u00a0\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Participate in a \u201ccrash course\u201d offered by a quant firm: Citadel\u2019s Datathon, Jane Street INSIGHT or FOCUS, Two Sigma New Seekers Summit, etc.\u00a0\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Enter a trading competition. Cornell, MIT, UChicago, UToronto all have trading competitions sponsored by top HFT firms.\u00a0\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 Slightly tangential, but enter a college poker tournament (or poker-themed competition like MIT Pokerbots) that has HFT sponsors.\u00a0\n5\ufe0f\u20e3 Join or start your school\u2019s quant trading club. Many companies, including Databento, can provide free data & resources for your club.\u00a0Writing a case study on quant trading also helps. \n6\ufe0f\u20e3 Do a Kaggle competition by Jane Street, Optiver, etc.\u00a0\n7\ufe0f\u20e3 Do an externship or co-op if your school + target quant firms sponsor it.\u00a0If they don't, give your school a list of companies to reach out to. \n8\ufe0f\u20e3 Do an internship in a related field, e.g. Bloomberg, CME, Pico, etc.\u00a0\n9\ufe0f\u20e3 Utilize all of these opportunities to score an internship at a top-tier quant or HFT firm. Now that your foot is in the door, many other doors will automatically open. You\u2019ve made it. \n\nAs you can see, the easiest way to break into quant trading is while you're in college. If you\u2019re already a working professional, it\u2019s 10x harder, but you can still try your luck by:\n- Going back to school for a master\u2019s degree, e.g. CMU MSCF, Berkeley MFE, etc.\u00a0\n- Winning a Kaggle competition by Jane Street, Optiver, etc.\u00a0\n- Applying for a middle- or back-office role, e.g. software engineer, legal, HR, etc.\u00a0\n- Applying at a less competitive location.\u00a0\n- Working in a related field, e.g. Bloomberg, CME, Pico, etc. \n\nI tried to be as thorough and honest as possible. Is there anything I missed? Curious to hear your thoughts below!",

            "reshared_post_description": "One common question I've been getting is how to use order book data or MBO, outside of HFT. \n\n1. It allows you to properly sequence the backtest or simulation of any strategy or execution algo that uses passive orders.\n\n2. Almost all order book feeds provide visibility of every level in the book, which is useful for estimating things like capacity, sweep cost and slippage. This is meaningful if you trade large size or sparse instruments, not necessarily on a low latency basis.\n\n3. Incremental deltas are a more efficient format than book level snapshots, hence better for performance optimization.\n\n4. Some venues exclusively use an incremental order book feed as their main or only feed, so you have no choice but to start from one anyway.\n\n5. Because order book feeds are ubiquitous, it's easier to write software abstractions that just purely consume order book data at any venue rather than a platform that has to handle a mix of price level feeds and MBO.\n\n6. In the context of US equities, top-of-the-book data from the SIPs, which are typically associated with \"TAQ\" or \"L1 data\", leave out a lot of liquidity information compared to the order-based prop feeds: odd lots, non-top level at each venue, and trade aggressor side, imbalance, etc. Odd lots are particularly of interest make up about half of US market liquidity and will continue to grow in share. Trade side inference with rule-based approaches are not very accurate, e.g. the classical Lee-Ready algorithm is only accurate to 70~80%.\n\n7. There are a few widely-known classes of features that cannot be constructed perfectly from level-based data, e.g. book pressure, and will give a trivial increase in your model R^2 or other fit measures. For certain mid-frequency strategies, your top competitors are all using these so it becomes a necessity if you want to gain enough edge over them.",

It should be easy to add new venues when you have a good normalization format and the right abstractions in your software and APIs. We see a lot of market data providers that originally designed their infrastructure and normalization to handle 1 asset class (usually equities) and you can tell that other asset classes were an afterthought. \n\n#marketdata #api #apis #equities #futures #options #trading",

            "reshared_post_description": "The addition of the 6 new #Bitcoin ETFs today reminds me of a very important feature in trading systems that I see many trading firms and data vendors get wrong: how to handle intraday listings. Why is this important?\n\n1. Supporting intraday listings mean you can start trading a symbol as soon as it  becomes available. I've seen a number of inquiries on whether Databento will add the 6 new Bitcoin ETFs\u2014and yes, we do.\n\n2. This is especially important in derivatives where expirations happen all of the time, and options where new strikes get added intraday when the underlying moves. On CME which has weekly trading sessions, we see a net increase of 120k+ symbols over the course of the session\u2014that's many symbols you can't quote if we wait till post-session to add these symbols.\n\n3. It's important for consistency between real-time and historical data, i.e. \"point-in-time\" data, meaning our instrument definitions are actually timestamped to the nanosecond so you know when they were actually made available.\n\nThere's a crucial subtlety here. As point 2 states, it's bad for the symbol to only get added to your system/data after the trading session when it was listed, so what I've seen some data providers\u2014and trading firms\u2014do is to add them at the end of the trading session but backdate it in their historical data and retroactively include that symbol in their historical data!\n\nMeaning, symbol S gets listed at 2024-01-11T09:30, but they'd wait till 2024-01-11T20:00 to kick off an ETL pipeline that will add an entry that says S was available since 2024-01-11! (Yes, it was to the rest of the world, but to your team, it was only available on 2024-01-12.)\n\nArguably, having this kind of point-in-time data is even worse than missing out on the symbol for a day, because your backtests will always assume you were operationally capable of trading new listings on the day they were added, when you actually weren't!\n\n4. Some trading venues (*cough* KRX?) do weird things to you, so your system should safeguard against them changing the tick size intra-session, or against them using ephemeral instrument IDs that rotate, conflict, or get reused. A lot of the trading platform logic to support intraday listings will also help you mitigate these issues.\n\n#marketdata #algotrading #equities #ETFs #options #futures #CME #nyse",

Paper with empirical studies coming soon.\n\nIn the video, we show Tempus AI Inc (ticker TEM) on the week of the IPO, where heavy market spoofing can take place, with very large spreads an illiquidity.

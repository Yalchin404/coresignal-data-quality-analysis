    "description": "Backed by $40M and elite Silicon Valley VCs and strategics, Health Rhythms is a pioneering AI/behavioral sensing solution addressing the dual crises in mental health: insufficient access and lack of intervention effectiveness measurement.\n\nThe market now recognizes that there is no health without mental health.  By combining the multi-dimensional sensing capabilities of mobile phones with the power of embedded and cloud computing platforms and novel AI algorithms, we continuously, objectively, and accurately measure mental health status for the very first time. We are realizing the vision of precision medicine for mental health by anticipating clinical deterioration before it reaches crisis proportions and by delivering personalized, just-in-time interventions based on each patient\u2019s own behavioral profile.  We have a head start advantage of 35 years of empirical evidence, 957 peer-reviewed papers between our four co-founders, a universally recognized best-in-class team, a robust IP portfolio, and the largest mental health AI data set.\n\nUCHealth ($6B) declared \"Health Rhythms will change the face of care,\" and its number one strategic priority is to deploy our app to its 2.5M patients. Otsuka ($18B pharma) invested in Health Rhythms after assessing 500+ mental health companies, recognizing our potential to revolutionize the industry.",

But what many people find surprising is how much it affects our physical health and even our ability to find a job.\n\nTo understand how big of a problem mental illness is, we can compare it to physical illness. In 2002, the World Health Organization asked a group of doctors to assess the impact of physical and mental conditions on a healthy life.\n \nThe results are amazing (see graphic below). Mental illness is not only the most common illness among working-age people, it actually causes half of all disabilities in this group. That's as much as the combined effects of back pain, heart problems, lung issues, diabetes, cancer, and all the other illnesses. \n\n\u203c\ufe0fRead the\u00a0report here: https://lnkd.in/e8iAz3tt,\u00a0or check out an excellent, deeper analysis of the impact of mental health on the economy by Richard Layard\u00a0here: https://lnkd.in/ey6u6deN\n\n#healthrhythms #mentalhealth #digitalhealth #mentalhealthishealth",

But what many people find surprising is how much it affects our physical health and even our ability to find a job.\n\nTo understand how big of a problem mental illness is, we can compare it to physical illness. In 2002, the World Health Organization asked a group of doctors to assess the impact of physical and mental conditions on a healthy life.\n \nThe results are amazing (see graphic below). Mental illness is not only the most common illness among working-age people, it actually causes half of all disabilities in this group. That's as much as the combined effects of back pain, heart problems, lung issues, diabetes, cancer, and all the other illnesses. \n\n\u203c\ufe0fRead the\u00a0report here: https://lnkd.in/e8iAz3tt,\u00a0or check out an excellent, deeper analysis of the impact of mental health on the economy by Richard Layard\u00a0here: https://lnkd.in/ey6u6deN\n\n#healthrhythms #mentalhealth #digitalhealth #mentalhealthishealth",

The Behavioral Vital Signs\u2122 Report shows you their trends over time, highlights key areas for discussion, and helps you operate a data-driven practice.

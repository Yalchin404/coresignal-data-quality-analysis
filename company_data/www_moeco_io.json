Think of a big GPS tracker, about as big as 3-4 iPhones stacked up, needing bolts and screws to attach it and take it off. Imagine this \u2013 you need to track 10,000 containers or pallets every year. That means about 500 hours just spent on putting on and taking off these devices. That's half a year's work just doing this one boring job.\n\nBut what if you have even more containers? Like 500,000 a year. This job gets really big, needing a whole team just for this repetitive task.\n\nNow, here's what Moeco offers: it's a simple sticker. Peel it off, stick it on, and you're all set in 5 seconds. That's right \u2013 only 5 seconds for each container, not the 3 minutes the typical way takes.\n\nThis isn't just saving time; it's a big jump in how efficiently you use your resources. Moeco is not just about tracking things; we're about making it super easy to fit into your logistics work.\n\n#supplychain #supplychainsolutions #logisticssolutions",

To put it simply, there isn't one we don't cover. \n\nOur sensors attach to containers or pallets, collecting real-time data on location, temperature, humidity, shocks, and light during land transport, be it via truck or rail.\n\nAt sea or in the air, they switch roles to data loggers, storing crucial information until they can reconnect to our platform to upload it. Despite the limited cell service over oceans or the strict rules for communication in air transport, they continue to record every critical aspect. As soon as they can reconnect, the complete data set is promptly transmitted to Moeco's platform.\n\nDiscover more on our website https://www.moeco.io/ or reach out here on LinkedIn.\n\n#supplychainsolutions",

Think of a big GPS tracker, about as big as 3-4 iPhones stacked up, needing bolts and screws to attach it and take it off. Imagine this \u2013 you need to track 10,000 containers or pallets every year. That means about 500 hours just spent on putting on and taking off these devices. That's half a year's work just doing this one boring job.\n\nBut what if you have even more containers? Like 500,000 a year. This job gets really big, needing a whole team just for this repetitive task.\n\nNow, here's what Moeco offers: it's a simple sticker. Peel it off, stick it on, and you're all set in 5 seconds. That's right \u2013 only 5 seconds for each container, not the 3 minutes the typical way takes.\n\nThis isn't just saving time; it's a big jump in how efficiently you use your resources. Moeco is not just about tracking things; we're about making it super easy to fit into your logistics work.\n\n#supplychain #supplychainsolutions #logisticssolutions",

To put it simply, there isn't one we don't cover. \n\nOur sensors attach to containers or pallets, collecting real-time data on location, temperature, humidity, shocks, and light during land transport, be it via truck or rail.\n\nAt sea or in the air, they switch roles to data loggers, storing crucial information until they can reconnect to our platform to upload it. Despite the limited cell service over oceans or the strict rules for communication in air transport, they continue to record every critical aspect. As soon as they can reconnect, the complete data set is promptly transmitted to Moeco's platform.\n\nDiscover more on our website https://www.moeco.io/ or reach out here on LinkedIn.\n\n#supplychainsolutions",

            "description": "How long does it take to install Moeco trackers?\n\nWhen it comes to putting tracking devices on containers, the usual way takes a lot of time. Think of a big GPS tracker, about as big as 3-4 iPhones stacked up, needing bolts and screws to attach it and take it off. Imagine this \u2013 you need to track 10,000 containers or pallets every year. That means about 500 hours just spent on putting on and taking off these devices. That's half a year's work just doing this one boring job.\n\nBut what if you have even more containers? Like 500,000 a year. This job gets really big, needing a whole team just for this repetitive task.\n\nNow, here's what Moeco offers: it's a simple sticker. Peel it off, stick it on, and you're all set in 5 seconds. That's right \u2013 only 5 seconds for each container, not the 3 minutes the typical way takes.\n\nThis isn't just saving time; it's a big jump in how efficiently you use your resources. Moeco is not just about tracking things; we're about making it super easy to fit into your logistics work.\n\n#supplychain #supplychainsolutions #logisticssolutions",

By making every container a source of actionable data, you\u2019re creating opportunities to offer something more. Imagine being able to spot issues before they become problems, offering that kind of proactive support to your clients.\n\nFor example, ensuring perishable goods stay within safe temperature ranges throughout the journey \u2014 without waiting for manual reports \u2014 could mean the difference between a smooth delivery and a costly loss. This isn\u2019t just added service; it\u2019s a whole new way of managing freight, where trust and reliability become your selling points.\n\nFor freight forwarders, this shift doesn\u2019t just improve client satisfaction \u2014 it translates directly into extra revenue by turning visibility into a premium offering. The ability to provide your clients with real-time insights builds a new level of trust, allowing you to charge more for a service that\u2019s proven to protect their goods and bottom line.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that real-time visibility is no longer a \u201cnice to have\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s becoming a critical part of standing out in today\u2019s market.",

            "description": "When you think about it, real-time visibility isn\u2019t just about tracking \u2014 it\u2019s about transforming how you deliver value. By making every container a source of actionable data, you\u2019re creating opportunities to offer something more. Imagine being able to spot issues before they become problems, offering that kind of proactive support to your clients.\n\nFor example, ensuring perishable goods stay within safe temperature ranges throughout the journey \u2014 without waiting for manual reports \u2014 could mean the difference between a smooth delivery and a costly loss. This isn\u2019t just added service; it\u2019s a whole new way of managing freight, where trust and reliability become your selling points.\n\nFor freight forwarders, this shift doesn\u2019t just improve client satisfaction \u2014 it translates directly into extra revenue by turning visibility into a premium offering. The ability to provide your clients with real-time insights builds a new level of trust, allowing you to charge more for a service that\u2019s proven to protect their goods and bottom line.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that real-time visibility is no longer a \u201cnice to have\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s becoming a critical part of standing out in today\u2019s market.",

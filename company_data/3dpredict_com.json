    "description": "3D Predict is an aligner manufacturer. Our aligners are driven by artificial intelligence that predictably helps treat all cases of complexity. Yep, we can do what most people think only braces can do! \n\nWorking to boost treatment effectiveness and reduce the number of refinements, our team created software driven by artificial intelligence (AI) called Deep CBCT Analysis.\n\nWe saw a way to combine clinical experience and cutting-edge AI technology to equip orthodontists with an aligner that helps treat even the most complex cases with greater precision and efficiency.\n\nWith Deep CBCT Analysis, orthodontists can effectively straighten teeth while keeping them within the alveolar housing \u2014 looking beyond a tooth crown to see the real roots and bone. This AI-driven software creates highly precise 3D models of crowns, bones, and actual roots with every detail of the apex visible so each tooth can be deeply analyzed like never before. By seeing how roots will move versus the bone during treatment, orthodontists are able to achieve more predictable and safe outcomes for patients unlike anything else that\u2019s currently available on the market.\n\n3D Predict was founded by Dr. Marina Domracheva. Her passion for mathematics drives our work in advanced technology to improve clinical effectiveness in dental care. Dr. Domracheva identified a gap in tooth straightening propositions available on the market and founded 3D Predict to inspire orthodontists to see the unseen and allow them to look beyond the evidence in treatment planning. \n\nOur clinical experts and 3D plan modeling technicians are among the best in the industry, the majority receiving deep orthodontic education.",

I\u2019m thrilled to closely align with Google to innovate with Generative AI and build new products. \nGoogle has been at the forefront of AI research and development, and partnering with them can provide access to cutting-edge technology and expertise.\nI believe that this partnership with Google and the use of Generative AI has the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes despite staff shortages in dentistry. \n\nDenelle Shemesh Uday Ghatikar and Enio Frota thank you so much for this opportunity to leverage the power of GenAI to improve orthodontics and beyond (overall oral health).",

According to the latest\u00a0Economic Outlook and Emerging Issues in Dentistry study from the ADA, over one-third of dentists are actively recruiting dental hygienists and assistants, highlighting the critical nature of this issue. Looking ahead,\u00a0a staggering 60% of surveyed dentists\u00a0have identified staffing shortages, recruitment, or retention as their primary challenge for the year.\n\n\ud83d\udcc8Seizing Efficiency with 3D Predict Aligners \n\nAmidst these challenges, integrating 3D Predict aligners into your practice presents a strategic opportunity to optimize efficiency and streamline operations:\n\n\u25aa\ufe0fMinimal Staff Requirement:\u00a0Most patient visits for 3D Predict aligners are brief, typically around 15 minutes, and require minimal assistance. In fact, one staff member can efficiently handle these visits, which predominantly involve verifying the fit of the next aligner.\n\n\u25aa\ufe0fAdvanced AI Technology:\u00a0Powered by advanced AI algorithms based on comprehensive orthodontic data, 3D Predict aligners precisely calculate the optimal forces required to move teeth and their accurate placement. This technology minimizes the need for refinements*, allowing for efficient treatment progression and fewer patient visits.\n\n\u25aa\ufe0fMaximize Chair Time:\u00a0Shorter and more streamlined patient visits not only enhance patient satisfaction but also free up valuable chair time. This enables you to accommodate more patients or focus on more complex procedures, addressing the increasing demand for dental services reported by\u00a0over one-third of dentists who find themselves overworked post-pandemic. \n\n\ud83d\ude80Embrace Innovation for Your Practice \n\nBy incorporating 3D Predict aligners, you not only mitigate the impact of staffing shortages but also elevate the standard of care and operational efficiency within your practice. This strategic move allows you to meet patient demand effectively while optimizing practice productivity.\n\n\ud83d\udcf8The pictures below illustrate what can be achieved within just six appointments with the work of a single dental specialist.\n\n*3D Predict data on file 3D Plan Approval.

They were then presented with comprehensive visualizations of the periodontal impact, including root and bone views from CBCT scans. The findings were profound: detailed 3D information on crown, root, and bone often led to revised treatment plans. Notably, identifying issues such as dehiscence and fenestrations through root and bone views led to practitioner dissatisfaction, despite initial positive assessments based solely on crown views.\n\nDeep CBCT Analysis:\n\nWhen uploading a CBCT scan, you will unlock two new modules:\n\n\ud83d\udd0dRoot Module: Shows the patient's real root and bone anatomy.\n\ud83d\udd0dBone Module: Highlights the thickness of the cortical plate.\n\nThe Results:\n\nThese findings highlight the critical role of 3D imaging and deep learning in optimizing patient outcomes and satisfaction. As CBCT technology in orthodontics advances, understanding its application for specific cases is essential for precise treatment planning.\n\n#Orthodontics #ClearAligners #3DPredict #CBCT #DentalTechnology #PatientCare #OrthodonticResearch",

            "description": "\ud83e\uddb7\u2728Overcoming Dental Staff Shortages with 3D Predict Aligners:\u00a0A Smart Move for Your Practice \n\nAs we navigate the evolving landscape of dentistry in 2024, one of the most significant challenges facing practices nationwide continues to be the shortage of skilled dental staff. According to the latest\u00a0Economic Outlook and Emerging Issues in Dentistry study from the ADA, over one-third of dentists are actively recruiting dental hygienists and assistants, highlighting the critical nature of this issue. Looking ahead,\u00a0a staggering 60% of surveyed dentists\u00a0have identified staffing shortages, recruitment, or retention as their primary challenge for the year.\n\n\ud83d\udcc8Seizing Efficiency with 3D Predict Aligners \n\nAmidst these challenges, integrating 3D Predict aligners into your practice presents a strategic opportunity to optimize efficiency and streamline operations:\n\n\u25aa\ufe0fMinimal Staff Requirement:\u00a0Most patient visits for 3D Predict aligners are brief, typically around 15 minutes, and require minimal assistance. In fact, one staff member can efficiently handle these visits, which predominantly involve verifying the fit of the next aligner.\n\n\u25aa\ufe0fAdvanced AI Technology:\u00a0Powered by advanced AI algorithms based on comprehensive orthodontic data, 3D Predict aligners precisely calculate the optimal forces required to move teeth and their accurate placement. This technology minimizes the need for refinements*, allowing for efficient treatment progression and fewer patient visits.\n\n\u25aa\ufe0fMaximize Chair Time:\u00a0Shorter and more streamlined patient visits not only enhance patient satisfaction but also free up valuable chair time. This enables you to accommodate more patients or focus on more complex procedures, addressing the increasing demand for dental services reported by\u00a0over one-third of dentists who find themselves overworked post-pandemic. \n\n\ud83d\ude80Embrace Innovation for Your Practice \n\nBy incorporating 3D Predict aligners, you not only mitigate the impact of staffing shortages but also elevate the standard of care and operational efficiency within your practice. This strategic move allows you to meet patient demand effectively while optimizing practice productivity.\n\n\ud83d\udcf8The pictures below illustrate what can be achieved within just six appointments with the work of a single dental specialist.\n\n*3D Predict data on file 3D Plan Approval.

They were then presented with comprehensive visualizations of the periodontal impact, including root and bone views from CBCT scans. The findings were profound: detailed 3D information on crown, root, and bone often led to revised treatment plans. Notably, identifying issues such as dehiscence and fenestrations through root and bone views led to practitioner dissatisfaction, despite initial positive assessments based solely on crown views.\n\nDeep CBCT Analysis:\n\nWhen uploading a CBCT scan, you will unlock two new modules:\n\n\ud83d\udd0dRoot Module: Shows the patient's real root and bone anatomy.\n\ud83d\udd0dBone Module: Highlights the thickness of the cortical plate.\n\nThe Results:\n\nThese findings highlight the critical role of 3D imaging and deep learning in optimizing patient outcomes and satisfaction. As CBCT technology in orthodontics advances, understanding its application for specific cases is essential for precise treatment planning.\n\n#Orthodontics #ClearAligners #3DPredict #CBCT #DentalTechnology #PatientCare #OrthodonticResearch",

According to the latest\u00a0Economic Outlook and Emerging Issues in Dentistry study from the ADA, over one-third of dentists are actively recruiting dental hygienists and assistants, highlighting the critical nature of this issue. Looking ahead,\u00a0a staggering 60% of surveyed dentists\u00a0have identified staffing shortages, recruitment, or retention as their primary challenge for the year.\n\n\ud83d\udcc8Seizing Efficiency with 3D Predict Aligners \n\nAmidst these challenges, integrating 3D Predict aligners into your practice presents a strategic opportunity to optimize efficiency and streamline operations:\n\n\u25aa\ufe0fMinimal Staff Requirement:\u00a0Most patient visits for 3D Predict aligners are brief, typically around 15 minutes, and require minimal assistance. In fact, one staff member can efficiently handle these visits, which predominantly involve verifying the fit of the next aligner.\n\n\u25aa\ufe0fAdvanced AI Technology:\u00a0Powered by advanced AI algorithms based on comprehensive orthodontic data, 3D Predict aligners precisely calculate the optimal forces required to move teeth and their accurate placement. This technology minimizes the need for refinements*, allowing for efficient treatment progression and fewer patient visits.\n\n\u25aa\ufe0fMaximize Chair Time:\u00a0Shorter and more streamlined patient visits not only enhance patient satisfaction but also free up valuable chair time. This enables you to accommodate more patients or focus on more complex procedures, addressing the increasing demand for dental services reported by\u00a0over one-third of dentists who find themselves overworked post-pandemic. \n\n\ud83d\ude80Embrace Innovation for Your Practice \n\nBy incorporating 3D Predict aligners, you not only mitigate the impact of staffing shortages but also elevate the standard of care and operational efficiency within your practice. This strategic move allows you to meet patient demand effectively while optimizing practice productivity.\n\n\ud83d\udcf8The pictures below illustrate what can be achieved within just six appointments with the work of a single dental specialist.\n\n*3D Predict data on file 3D Plan Approval.

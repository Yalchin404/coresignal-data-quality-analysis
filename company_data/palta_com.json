For others, it was a great chance to see oneself from an unusual angle, experiment with a future hairdo, or clothing style, or maybe even get motivated to remain on a fitness journey.\u00a0\n\nI see #Lensa achieving something much more important here:\u00a0\nThe app\u2019s latest feature, Magic Avatars has pushed us out of a vicious circle of filtering, airbrushing, enhancing our own images to consciously hide imperfections and achieve a \u201ccertain look\u201d - all these to ultimately gain approval on Social.\u00a0 Magic Avatars\u2019 experience is a personal one. It is meant to invite one to exercise imagination, encounter various unconventional interpretations of oneself, and choose the ones that resonate with oneself the most.\nThe end result is always unique, ingenious and always very human.\n\n@Prisma Lab\u2019s team had been on a mission to defy trends and develop a product beyond yet another photo-editing feature, for a number of years, before the successful release of Magic Avatars last month.\u00a0\nWhat is more important - It resonates well with users - the app is enjoying outstanding feedback on the app store, landing today at over 50,000 5-star reviews, according to SensorTower. \n\nMyself along with a wider team here at Palta value an opportunity to support @Prisma Lab\u2019s on this long 6-year journey from day one,\u00a0 and help it realize its true potential, while navigating together through some of the most complex, thought-provoking, and inspiring areas of the tech industry.",

They define our unique ability to lucid dream - a process which has been scientifically proven to further enhance both abstract thinking and creativity - thus, becoming a perpetual source of inspiration for ourselves\u201d.\n\nPrisma Labs, Inc. #Lensa AI\u2019s new feature, Magic Avatars, invites users to re-imagine themselves as a Sci-Fi character, a Superhero, an Adventurer, a Rockstar or even a Mystical Being. It offers a fun and playful glimpse into what one could look like by processing existing images and converting them into imaginative, artistic depictions.\n\nToday #Lensa AI has hit the\u00a0No. 1 spot on the iOS App Store thanks to an endless human curiosity and natural drive to imagine and be inspired \ud83d\udc9a \n#intelligence #mindfulness #ios #ai #inspiration",

And now imagine that for some reason you want to keep all your bricks organized (doesn\u2019t ever happen to your average 5 y.o. \ud83e\udd37\u2642\ufe0f ) so that you can find them easily when you want to play. \u00a0\nA data platform is kind of like that large drawer that helps you keep all your information organized and quick to find: all your LEGOs neatly stacked and sorted, brilliant, isn\u2019t it?\u00a0\nWe can also think of Palta Brain as an assistant. It helps startups divide their customers into smaller groups, so that they can approach each group in a unique way. \u00a0\nTo illustrate this, let's pretend you have a bag of sweets, and you wish to share them with your friends (again, why on Earth would you? \ud83e\udd37\u2642\ufe0f ). You might, however, decide to give your best friend and your cousin different sweets. The same way startups can use Palta Brain to send different messages to different groups of customers.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ud835\ude52\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude69 \ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude63 \ud835\ude6e\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude67 \ud835\ude6b\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude6c \ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude68 \u201c\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude63\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude6d\ud835\ude69 \ud835\ude57\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude5c \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude5c\u201d \ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude63 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude5d?\nAI will continue to play an increasingly important role in many industries and aspects of society. If we talk about HealthTech, AI is expected to play a major role in improving the accuracy of diagnoses and medical treatments, streamlining the drug discovery process, and enabling a more personalized approach. \n\n\ud835\ude52\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude69 \ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude56 \ud835\ude68\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude5c\ud835\ude61\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude58\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude61 \ud835\ude66\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude61\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude6e \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude69 \ud835\ude64\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude63\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude59\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64 \ud835\ude65\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude68\ud835\ude68\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude68\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude63 \ud835\ude6e\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude67 \ud835\ude67\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude61\ud835\ude5a?\nThere are a few qualities that can be important for performing effectively in my role. If I had to choose one, I would say the most important quality for a Data Platform Engineer is technical expertise. \u00a0\nA deep understanding of various data storage and processing technologies is crucial for designing, building, and maintaining a scalable data platform that can effectively support data-driven applications and insights. \u00a0\nSo, it all boils down to your experience.\n \u00a0\n\ud835\ude3f\ud835\ude64 \ud835\ude6e\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude6a \ud835\ude65\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67 \u201c\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude61\ud835\ude6e\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude5c \ud835\ude68\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude61\ud835\ude64 \"\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude67 \ud835\ude57\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude5c \ud835\ude56 \ud835\ude65\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude69 \ud835\ude64\ud835\ude5b \ud835\ude56 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude62? \ud835\ude52\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude6e?\nI would likely prefer to be a part of a team, as collaboration can improve overall results and create a more enjoyable work environment.\u00a0\nI also appreciate an ability to work independently and take initiative on certain tasks.

And now imagine that for some reason you want to keep all your bricks organized (doesn\u2019t ever happen to your average 5 y.o. \ud83e\udd37\u2642\ufe0f ) so that you can find them easily when you want to play. \u00a0\nA data platform is kind of like that large drawer that helps you keep all your information organized and quick to find: all your LEGOs neatly stacked and sorted, brilliant, isn\u2019t it?\u00a0\nWe can also think of Palta Brain as an assistant. It helps startups divide their customers into smaller groups, so that they can approach each group in a unique way. \u00a0\nTo illustrate this, let's pretend you have a bag of sweets, and you wish to share them with your friends (again, why on Earth would you? \ud83e\udd37\u2642\ufe0f ). You might, however, decide to give your best friend and your cousin different sweets. The same way startups can use Palta Brain to send different messages to different groups of customers.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ud835\ude52\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude69 \ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude63 \ud835\ude6e\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude67 \ud835\ude6b\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude6c \ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude68 \u201c\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude63\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude6d\ud835\ude69 \ud835\ude57\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude5c \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude5c\u201d \ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude63 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude5d?\nAI will continue to play an increasingly important role in many industries and aspects of society.

I always say that in a small business you have to be comfortable with what you\u2019re NOT DOING. In a large enterprise with 200 people doing security, you can just DO IT ALL. \nThat\u2019s not to say that security in a large company is easy, because it really isn\u2019t - it\u2019s just a different focus and way of operating.\n\n\ud835\ude52\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude69 \ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude56 \ud835\ude68\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude5c\ud835\ude61\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude58\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude61 \ud835\ude66\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude61\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude6e \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude69 \ud835\ude64\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude63\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude59\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64 \ud835\ude65\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude68\ud835\ude68\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude68\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude63 \ud835\ude6e\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude67 \ud835\ude67\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude61\ud835\ude5a?\nPragmatism. \nYou can learn all you want about the best way to secure things, but eventually that bumps up against the real world of what the business needs, so you need to know how to get to \u201csecure enough\u201d. \n\n\ud835\ude52\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude69 \ud835\ude56\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude6e\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude67 \ud835\ude6b\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude6c\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude64\ud835\ude63 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude68\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude64\ud835\ude5b \ud835\ude65\ud835\ude61\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude6e \ud835\ude6c\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude63 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude58\ud835\ude6e\ud835\ude57\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67 \ud835\ude68\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude6e \ud835\ude68\ud835\ude65\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude5a/\ud835\ude57\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude68\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude68\ud835\ude68?\nThe state of play is that there isn\u2019t really a state of play! \nThere\u2019s a very high rate of change and the trend of increasingly sophisticated threats isn\u2019t going away. A large number of people underestimate the impact that cyber attacks can have, meaning that we still see underinvestment, and data breaches happening due to basic controls not being implemented properly. \nSecurity vendors have all sorts of magical solutions to all sorts of terrible possibilities, but right now many companies are still at the stage where they just need to focus on excellent execution of the basics.\n\n\ud835\ude52\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude69 \ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude62\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude68\ud835\ude69 \ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude62\ud835\ude65\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude69 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude5c \ud835\ude6e\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude6a\u2019\ud835\ude59 \ud835\ude61\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude60\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64 \ud835\ude56\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude6b\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude59\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude5c \ud835\ude6e\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude67 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude62\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude6c\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5d \ud835\ude4b\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude61\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude56?\nIf I can leave Palta with an Information Security Programme that is ready to adapt to the challenges ahead, then I\u2019ll be happy.\n\n#data #cisolife #healthtech #cybersecurity #ciso",

Working in a juxtaposition both processes create a tremendous toll on the heart, encouraging arrhythmia, and in the worst case scenario, leading up to a cardiac arrest. \n\n\ud835\udde6\ud835\uddfc \ud835\ude04\ud835\uddf5\ud835\ude06 \ud835\uddee\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddf2 \ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddf0\ud835\uddf2 \ud835\uddef\ud835\uddee\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf5\ud835\ude00 \ud835\ude00\ud835\uddfc \ud835\uddfd\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfd\ud835\ude02\ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddff? \nAs a consequence one experiences a release of adrenaline and endorphins, and these invigorates us. Humans in general tend to lead towards extremes; it seems to us that the more we push the boundaries, the more useful it is. Alas, when it comes to health, the \u201cgolden mean\u201d principle is most often the best approach.\u00a0\nOf course you\u00a0 can feel like a hero just lying in your bath, BUT narcissism kills and humbleness cures.\n\n\ud835\uddea\ud835\uddf5\ud835\uddee\ud835\ude01 \ud835\uddee\ud835\uddef\ud835\uddfc\ud835\ude02\ud835\ude01 \ud835\uddff\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddf4\ud835\ude02\ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddff \ud835\uddf2\ud835\ude05\ud835\uddfd\ud835\uddfc\ud835\ude00\ud835\ude02\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddf2 \ud835\ude01\ud835\uddfc \ud835\uddf0\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddf1?\nIt\u2019s helpful, when done in moderation. Instead of ice baths, you can take air baths, as Benjamin Franklin did.

            "description": "A recent report from 4 Day Week - Global, who conducted a four-day working week trial, revealed an extensive list of wellbeing benefits including:\n\n\ud83d\ude13 71% reported lower burnout and 39% lower levels of stress\n\ud83e\udd31 21% reported reduction in child care costs \n\ud83d\udcbc 57% reduction in staff resignations during the trial \n\nIt is now evident that the future of work lies in finding the right balance between flexibility and structure. \n\nAt Palta, we are always looking for ways to provide our employees with the flexibility they need to maintain a healthy work-life balance while still achieving organizational goals. \nFinding that balance can be tricky, but it's an essential part of creating a successful and productive workplace.\n\nPalta\u2019s \ud83e\uddd8\u2642\ufe0f Head of Mindfulness, Walter Gjergja, agrees: \n\n\u201cWe have to start working smart and realize that a greater time allocation to nurturing our wellbeing will most likely lead to a dramatic improvement of both our professional outputs \ud835\ude56\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude59  personal welfare .\n\nIn recent years there has finally been an industry-wide awakening concentrated on shifting away from the so-called \u201c\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude68\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude61\ud835\ude5a-\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude61\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a\u201d. We see businesses striving to understand the many nuances surrounding this complex matter by experimenting with flexible working hours, remote-first work, employee wellbeing programs etc.\n\nIn the \u26e9 Shaolin Temple \u26e9 , where I did part of my studies, we say that\u00a0 there must be a balance of \u201c\ud835\ude6c\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude67\u201d and \"\ud835\ude62\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude60\u201d . The warrior is the inner \ud835\ude59\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\u00a0 and the monk is the inner \ud835\ude58\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67; it is only by maintaining a correct harmony of the two that we can achieve mastery and serenity in life ... \nOnly \ud835\ude59\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude5c will exhaust our resources, only \ud835\ude58\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude5c will not lead to many accomplishments.\u201d\n\n#wellbeing #futureofwork #workinghours #flexibleworking #remotejobs",

And now imagine that for some reason you want to keep all your bricks organized (doesn\u2019t ever happen to your average 5 y.o. \ud83e\udd37\u2642\ufe0f ) so that you can find them easily when you want to play. \u00a0\nA data platform is kind of like that large drawer that helps you keep all your information organized and quick to find: all your LEGOs neatly stacked and sorted, brilliant, isn\u2019t it?\u00a0\nWe can also think of Palta Brain as an assistant. It helps startups divide their customers into smaller groups, so that they can approach each group in a unique way. \u00a0\nTo illustrate this, let's pretend you have a bag of sweets, and you wish to share them with your friends (again, why on Earth would you? \ud83e\udd37\u2642\ufe0f ). You might, however, decide to give your best friend and your cousin different sweets. The same way startups can use Palta Brain to send different messages to different groups of customers.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ud835\ude52\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude69 \ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude63 \ud835\ude6e\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude67 \ud835\ude6b\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude6c \ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude68 \u201c\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude63\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude6d\ud835\ude69 \ud835\ude57\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude5c \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude5c\u201d \ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude63 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude5d?\nAI will continue to play an increasingly important role in many industries and aspects of society.

Working in a juxtaposition both processes create a tremendous toll on the heart, encouraging arrhythmia, and in the worst case scenario, leading up to a cardiac arrest. \n\n\ud835\udde6\ud835\uddfc \ud835\ude04\ud835\uddf5\ud835\ude06 \ud835\uddee\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddf2 \ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddf0\ud835\uddf2 \ud835\uddef\ud835\uddee\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf5\ud835\ude00 \ud835\ude00\ud835\uddfc \ud835\uddfd\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfd\ud835\ude02\ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddff? \nAs a consequence one experiences a release of adrenaline and endorphins, and these invigorates us. Humans in general tend to lead towards extremes; it seems to us that the more we push the boundaries, the more useful it is. Alas, when it comes to health, the \u201cgolden mean\u201d principle is most often the best approach.\u00a0\nOf course you\u00a0 can feel like a hero just lying in your bath, BUT narcissism kills and humbleness cures.\n\n\ud835\uddea\ud835\uddf5\ud835\uddee\ud835\ude01 \ud835\uddee\ud835\uddef\ud835\uddfc\ud835\ude02\ud835\ude01 \ud835\uddff\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddf4\ud835\ude02\ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddff \ud835\uddf2\ud835\ude05\ud835\uddfd\ud835\uddfc\ud835\ude00\ud835\ude02\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddf2 \ud835\ude01\ud835\uddfc \ud835\uddf0\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddf1?\nIt\u2019s helpful, when done in moderation. Instead of ice baths, you can take air baths, as Benjamin Franklin did. Daily cold showers and sleeping in a cool bedroom would also do you good.\nFor example, a 30 second cold shower \ud835\uddff\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddf1\ud835\ude02\ud835\uddf0\ud835\uddf2\ud835\ude00 \ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf5\ud835\uddf2 \ud835\uddff\ud835\uddf6\ud835\ude00\ud835\uddf8 of catching a cold by 29% .\n\nScientists have proven that it is beneficial to sleep in a cool bedroom, as this increases your amount of useful brown fat, improves insulin sensitivity, and helps burn calories. \nEven coolness at 19C is quite effective in \ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf0\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddee\ud835\ude00\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf4 \ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf5\ud835\uddf2 \ud835\uddee\ud835\uddf0\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf6\ud835\ude03\ud835\uddf6\ud835\ude01\ud835\ude06 of brown fat by 30\u201340%.\n\nOne might not land any Instagram-worthy content by engaging in these activities, but it is much safer, and better for your health and environment \ud83d\udc9a \n\n#growth  #science #healthandwellbeing #awareness #trend #mentalhealth #biohacking #icebath #wimhof",

[healthtech edition]\n\nAnother wonderful event hosted by Palta and learnt from inspiring speakers Thuria Wenbar, Konstantin Yakovlev, Kai Koch, Patrick Fagan and Dr. Ashish Patel, MD discussing the importance of building healthtech products with empathy.  \n\nSome key takeaways:\n\ud83e\udd16 Machine learning models give predictions, but a human makes the ultimate decision\n\ud83e\udd16 Emotional intelligence (eg. chatbots) providing timely and relevant information with engagement retention\n\ud83e\udde0 Mitigating risks and maximising benefits to patients with generative AI\n\ud83e\udde0 Providing value at scale from digital to non-digital solutions by avoiding jargon and using human language\n\nBuilding products is intuitive, but building products with empathy and soul makes non-human solutions humane. It connects with patients/ users more personally and empowers them on a meaningful level. \n\n\ud835\ude1a\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude36\ud835\ude2d excited to see what the future holds!

            "description": "\ud83d\udeb0 Water is the most valuable life component on Earth, second only to air. While we cannot really forget to breathe, we do tend to ignore our daily need for staying hydrated. This #WorldWaterDay Andrew Belaveshkin MD PhD Palta's \ud83d\udc9a Medical Advisor offers three simple tactics for staying on the top of your game:\n\n\ud835\uddd4\ud835\uddf1\ud835\uddf7\ud835\ude02\ud835\ude00\ud835\ude01 \ud835\uddec\ud835\uddfc\ud835\ude02\ud835\uddff \ud835\uddea\ud835\uddee\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddff \ud835\uddd5\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf0\ud835\uddf2\nAlways keep your water bottle handy, and if you do at any point feel or think that you might be thirsty just take a sip and see if this sensation enhances. If it does, then you do indeed need to replenish your biofluids reserves. \nThis simple method of sample siping is highly effective and quick to adapt.\n\n\ud835\uddd8\ud835\ude03\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddf9\ud835\ude02\ud835\uddee\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf2 \ud835\uddec\ud835\uddfc\ud835\ude02\ud835\uddff \ud835\uddea\ud835\uddee\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddff \ud835\uddd5\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf0\ud835\uddf2\nDehydration manifests itself via multiple \ud83d\udea9 red flags \ud83d\udea9  - dry skin sensation, itchy eyes, dry mouth, muscle weakness, you name it! However the most accurate indicator is\u2026the shade of urine. You may often not fully realize how thirsty you really are until you visit the bathroom (refer to the chart \ud83d\udc47).\nFor example, if you find yourself under a considerable amount of stress, the sensation of being thirsty can get dulled and go unnoticed for hours.This will immediately reflect in the color of a urine sample (unless you take certain daily vitamins and supplements). It\u2019s key to mention that thirst disappears before your water deficiency gets fully compensated, so it is important to have access to water within the next 15-20 min after quenching your thirst.\n\n\ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddf5\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfc\ud835\ude00\ud835\uddf2 \ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf5\ud835\uddf2 \ud835\uddd5\ud835\uddf2\ud835\ude00\ud835\ude01 \ud835\uddea\ud835\uddee\ud835\ude06 \ud835\uddf3\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddff \ud835\udde6\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddee\ud835\ude06\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf4 \ud835\udddb\ud835\ude06\ud835\uddf1\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddee\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddf1\nHerbal teas with fresh mint or lemon can also suffice. Some green tea, cacao, or even a couple cups of coffee ( \u2615 \u2615 not more) should do the trick.\nPlease remember that juices, milk and even plant based milk are poor sources of hydration. Sugary drinks will simply make you more thirsty.\u00a0 So what is the best drink? Just water!\n\n#healthtech #worldwaterday2023 #hydration #health",

            "description": "\ud83d\udeb0 Water is the most valuable life component on Earth, second only to air. While we cannot really forget to breathe, we do tend to ignore our daily need for staying hydrated. This #WorldWaterDay Andrew Belaveshkin MD PhD Palta's \ud83d\udc9a Medical Advisor offers three simple tactics for staying on the top of your game:\n\n\ud835\uddd4\ud835\uddf1\ud835\uddf7\ud835\ude02\ud835\ude00\ud835\ude01 \ud835\uddec\ud835\uddfc\ud835\ude02\ud835\uddff \ud835\uddea\ud835\uddee\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddff \ud835\uddd5\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf0\ud835\uddf2\nAlways keep your water bottle handy, and if you do at any point feel or think that you might be thirsty just take a sip and see if this sensation enhances. If it does, then you do indeed need to replenish your biofluids reserves. \nThis simple method of sample siping is highly effective and quick to adapt.\n\n\ud835\uddd8\ud835\ude03\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddf9\ud835\ude02\ud835\uddee\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf2 \ud835\uddec\ud835\uddfc\ud835\ude02\ud835\uddff \ud835\uddea\ud835\uddee\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddff \ud835\uddd5\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf0\ud835\uddf2\nDehydration manifests itself via multiple \ud83d\udea9 red flags \ud83d\udea9  - dry skin sensation, itchy eyes, dry mouth, muscle weakness, you name it! However the most accurate indicator is\u2026the shade of urine. You may often not fully realize how thirsty you really are until you visit the bathroom (refer to the chart \ud83d\udc47).\nFor example, if you find yourself under a considerable amount of stress, the sensation of being thirsty can get dulled and go unnoticed for hours.This will immediately reflect in the color of a urine sample (unless you take certain daily vitamins and supplements). It\u2019s key to mention that thirst disappears before your water deficiency gets fully compensated, so it is important to have access to water within the next 15-20 min after quenching your thirst.\n\n\ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddf5\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfc\ud835\ude00\ud835\uddf2 \ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf5\ud835\uddf2 \ud835\uddd5\ud835\uddf2\ud835\ude00\ud835\ude01 \ud835\uddea\ud835\uddee\ud835\ude06 \ud835\uddf3\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddff \ud835\udde6\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddee\ud835\ude06\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf4 \ud835\udddb\ud835\ude06\ud835\uddf1\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddee\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddf1\nHerbal teas with fresh mint or lemon can also suffice. Some green tea, cacao, or even a couple cups of coffee ( \u2615 \u2615 not more) should do the trick.\nPlease remember that juices, milk and even plant based milk are poor sources of hydration. Sugary drinks will simply make you more thirsty.\u00a0 So what is the best drink? Just water!\n\n#healthtech #worldwaterday2023 #hydration #health",

We won!!!\n\nThe first place in Parkinson's Disease Progression Prediction competition on Kaggle.\n\n1900 teams / 2000+ participants and 3 months timeline.\n\nThree months seems a long period, but I didn't even notice how time flew \u2014 all because of my INCREDIBLE teammate Dmitry Gordeev. The word incredible is written with caps by no mistake \u2014 he is/was/hope will be again a perfect partner \u2014 one of the best DS I've ever met, super intelligent, dedicated, full of ideas, supportive and just a nice person.\n\nI'm very very sorry to say that our solution will not be beneficial for patients with Parkinson's disease as we didn't find any stable signal in proteins and peptides. For such a small group of patients (600+) it is possible to find any (imaginable) correlation between patient health conditions and NPX with Peptide Abundance, even if no such correlation exists in reality. I'm sure that there is a \"signal\" in blood tests, but we need more data \u2014 much more data to make viable predictions.\n\nAnyway, during the competition we've created some very interesting technics for SMAPE (SMAPE1p) optimization with GBT models (the complete approach will be described soon by Dmitry, I'll share the link when it's ready) and this part would be beneficial for many many companies that are using SMAPE as a target metric, for example in retail industry or LTV models. \n\nCongratulations to all the winners and participants it was a pleasure to compete with you. \n\nThank you Kaggle and AMP-PD for hosting such an interesting competition.\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/dWVrJShM\n\n#ML #DS #Kaggle #SMAPE #Palta",

We\u2019ve asked Andrew Belaveshkin MD PhD, Palta's \ud83d\udc9a Medical Advisor to comment on this trend:\n\nTo begin with, a post-meal measurement of the levels of glucose (Postprandial Blood Sugar) serves as a very important indicator of one\u2019s metabolic health. Any deviation from the norm here is hard to spot otherwise, however it doesn\u2019t mean it comes with no long-term consequences.\n\nElevated Postprandial Glucose has a negative effect on the lining of\u00a0 blood vessels, causing oxidative stress and increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease. In addition, it can increase the level of chronic inflammation.\nWorth mentioning, that spikes in glucose levels can also lead to accelerated aging through the accumulation of damaged molecules.\n\nInterestingly, the glycemic response can vary from person to person. The volume of glucose spikes in response to particular food is highly individual and relies on a number of factors, like, for example, your microbiome, physical activity, sleep efficiency, day of the menstrual cycle, daylight exposure etc.\n\n\ud835\uddea\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddf9 \ud835\uddfd\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfd\ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddf2 \ud835\uddf4\ud835\uddf2\ud835\ude01 \ud835\uddee\ud835\uddfb\ud835\ude06 \ud835\uddef\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddf3\ud835\uddf6\ud835\ude01 \ud835\uddf3\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfa \ud835\uddf0\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfb\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfb\ud835\ude02\ud835\uddfc\ud835\ude02\ud835\ude00 \ud835\uddf4\ud835\uddf9\ud835\ude02\ud835\uddf0\ud835\uddfc\ud835\ude00\ud835\uddf2 \ud835\uddfa\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf6\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf4?\nUndoubtedly, the first benefit is \ud83d\udc9a motivation \ud83d\udc9a \n\nHowever, some further expectations of clinical effectiveness may not be justified.\u00a0\nAfter all, you cannot simply rely on a single data point in isolation -\u00a0 levels of glucose in the blood can be affected by psychological stress, cold air, dehydration, and dozens of other factors that are mostly out of our control.\n\nSaying that, CGM can really help tweak your diet if you've already put in some hard yards maintaining some basic nutrition, exercise, sleep, work balance, and recovery routines.\n\nIn the meantime\u00a0 I recommend following these simple steps for maintaining healthy glucose levels and flattening the glycemic curve:\n\n\ud83e\udd57 \ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddee\ud835\ude01 \ud835\udddf\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddf4\ud835\uddf5\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddff. Start with a salad, consume vegetables at every meal, avoid simple carbs, unless they are paired with greens or legumes.\n\n\ud83d\udeb6\u2642\ufe0f \ud835\udde7\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddf8\ud835\uddf2 \ud835\uddee \ud835\udde6\ud835\uddf5\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddff\ud835\ude01 \ud835\uddea\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddf8 \ud835\uddee\ud835\uddf3\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddff \ud835\uddd8\ud835\ude03\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddff\ud835\ude06 \ud835\udde0\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddf9. Just a 15 minute stroll\u00a0 is enough to smooth out the spike in glucose. After a work lunch, spend an hour at a standing desk.\n\n\u2696 \ud835\udde6\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddf0\ud835\uddf8 \ud835\ude01\ud835\uddfc \ud835\uddee \ud835\udde1\ud835\ude02\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddfb\ud835\ude01-\ud835\udde5\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddf0\ud835\uddf5 \ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddf2\ud835\ude01.

It reminded me that building a product with soul goes beyond technology \u2014 it requires a deep understanding of people's needs and a commitment to creating meaningful impact in their lives.\n\nThank you Palta for organising such a great event!\n\n#healthtech #innovation #startup #entrepreneurship #founders",

These measure progression in patients with Parkinson's disease. \n\nWe applaud this effort and teamwork \ud83d\udc4f \n\n#datascience #kaggle #healthtech #techblog #parkinsonsdisease #teamwork",

We won!!!\n\nThe first place in Parkinson's Disease Progression Prediction competition on Kaggle.\n\n1900 teams / 2000+ participants and 3 months timeline.\n\nThree months seems a long period, but I didn't even notice how time flew \u2014 all because of my INCREDIBLE teammate Dmitry Gordeev. The word incredible is written with caps by no mistake \u2014 he is/was/hope will be again a perfect partner \u2014 one of the best DS I've ever met, super intelligent, dedicated, full of ideas, supportive and just a nice person.\n\nI'm very very sorry to say that our solution will not be beneficial for patients with Parkinson's disease as we didn't find any stable signal in proteins and peptides. For such a small group of patients (600+) it is possible to find any (imaginable) correlation between patient health conditions and NPX with Peptide Abundance, even if no such correlation exists in reality. I'm sure that there is a \"signal\" in blood tests, but we need more data \u2014 much more data to make viable predictions.\n\nAnyway, during the competition we've created some very interesting technics for SMAPE (SMAPE1p) optimization with GBT models (the complete approach will be described soon by Dmitry, I'll share the link when it's ready) and this part would be beneficial for many many companies that are using SMAPE as a target metric, for example in retail industry or LTV models. \n\nCongratulations to all the winners and participants it was a pleasure to compete with you. \n\nThank you Kaggle and AMP-PD for hosting such an interesting competition.\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/dWVrJShM\n\n#ML #DS #Kaggle #SMAPE #Palta",

The event brought together a diverse range of speakers from industry-leading companies such as Huma, Too Good To Go, AVIE, Stride.VC, and Peanut App.\n\nHere are some key takeaways that resonated with me:\n\n\ud83c\udf31 Foster a deep connection with your community to build a product that truly resonates with their needs, aspirations, and values.\n\ud83d\udca1 Discover your unique niche and pursue excellence within it, consistently delivering exceptional value and impact.\n\ud83e\udd1d Collaborate with industry experts and thought leaders to infuse your product with diverse perspectives, expertise, and insights, creating a truly holistic solution.\n\ud83d\udcbc Prioritise finding the perfect market fit early on, investing the time and effort needed to deeply understand your target audience's pain points, desires, and behaviours.\n\ud83d\ude80 Embrace technology and AI as powerful tools to enhance human connection, empathy, and personalisation in your product, empowering users to achieve their health and wellness goals.\n\nAttending this event reaffirmed my belief in the transformative power of Health Tech. It reminded me that building a product with soul goes beyond technology \u2014 it requires a deep understanding of people's needs and a commitment to creating meaningful impact in their lives.\n\nThank you Palta for organising such a great event!\n\n#healthtech #innovation #startup #entrepreneurship #founders",

The event brought together a diverse range of speakers from industry-leading companies such as Huma, Too Good To Go, AVIE, Stride.VC, and Peanut App.\n\nHere are some key takeaways that resonated with me:\n\n\ud83c\udf31 Foster a deep connection with your community to build a product that truly resonates with their needs, aspirations, and values.\n\ud83d\udca1 Discover your unique niche and pursue excellence within it, consistently delivering exceptional value and impact.\n\ud83e\udd1d Collaborate with industry experts and thought leaders to infuse your product with diverse perspectives, expertise, and insights, creating a truly holistic solution.\n\ud83d\udcbc Prioritise finding the perfect market fit early on, investing the time and effort needed to deeply understand your target audience's pain points, desires, and behaviours.\n\ud83d\ude80 Embrace technology and AI as powerful tools to enhance human connection, empathy, and personalisation in your product, empowering users to achieve their health and wellness goals.\n\nAttending this event reaffirmed my belief in the transformative power of Health Tech. It reminded me that building a product with soul goes beyond technology \u2014 it requires a deep understanding of people's needs and a commitment to creating meaningful impact in their lives.\n\nThank you Palta for organising such a great event!\n\n#healthtech #innovation #startup #entrepreneurship #founders",

Now all they need to do is eat, log, and learn from the food feedback they get.\nLogging food with SIMPLE is now easier and more intuitive. Instead of scrolling a food database, users can just type in what they ate, snap a photo of their meal, or describe it using their voice.\nOnce a user has logged their food, it\u2019s analyzed by the Nutrition Scores system which the Simple App science team has infused with #nutrition knowledge and designed to reflect well-established nutrition guidelines. The user then gets a (judgment-free) Nutrition Score of Low, Fair, Good, or Optimal which shows the overall nutrition quality of their meal.\nThat\u2019s a game-changer, right there \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb:\n\nAny time a user feels stuck on what to do next, one glance at their Simple Home screen will point them in the right direction of what to do today, and where they\u2019re at with their overall day\u2019s Nutrition Score and within their fasting schedule.\nThese outstanding new features are another brick in the wall of\u00a0Simple App\u2019s vision to make improved health accessible to all.

Incorporating AI into our already-smart #tech is changing the game for how we support our users, and we\u2019re super excited to share some new features with you today!\u00a0 \n\n\ud83c\udf4f\ud83e\udd50\ud83c\udf45 INTRODUCING \u2026 our new and improved Food Tracker \n\nLogging food with SIMPLE is now easier, more intuitive, and quick as a flash. Instead of scrolling a food database, users can just type in what they ate, snap a photo of their meal, or describe it using their voice. \n\nWe\u2019re stoked with this update. But what comes next is even BETTER. \n\n\ud83d\udfe2\ud83d\udfe0\ud83d\udfe1 INTRODUCING \u2026 our new Nutrition Scores and food feedback \n\nOnce a user has logged their food, it\u2019s analyzed by our algorithm, which has been designed alongside our in-house science team to reflect well-established #nutrition guidelines. Each food is assessed in terms of nutritional factors that influence weight and health to give the user a Nutrition Score of Low, Fair, Good, or Optimal. This shows the overall nutritional quality of their meal. They can also see a daily Score, which is the average of all meal Scores logged that day. \n\nWe designed Nutrition Scores based on our belief that no food is either \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad.\u201d These Scores don\u2019t judge our users or their food choices. They\u2019re designed to guide \u2014 not guilt \u2014 them toward a healthier, more balanced diet over time, bringing their goals even more within reach. #nutritionmatters\n\n\ud83d\udcf2 INTRODUCING \u2026 our redesigned Home screen that guides users on what to do today, saving them time, and confusion, and smoothing out the bumpy road of building new habits. \n\nNow when users tap open their app, they have these key features in one place:\u00a0\n\ud83d\udcf2 the day\u2019s average Nutrition Score and logged meals\n\ud83d\udcf2 a button to log new meals (and edit previously logged meals)\n\ud83d\udcf2 where they are in their eating or fasting window\n\ud83d\udcf2 buttons to start or stop their fast or change their daily intermittent fasting schedule \n\n\ud83e\udd51 DON\u2019T FORGET \u2026 Avo, our recently launched AI-powered nutrition chatbot\n\nA final shout-out to Avo, who\u2019s on hand 24/7 to answer your wellness questions! Avo\u2019s now living its best life in the SIMPLE app, helping users zhuzh up their meals, feel more relaxed when stress-eating flares up, and stay motivated on their weight loss journey.\n\nLaunching these brand-new features in our SIMPLE app feels like Christmas Day: we can\u2019t wait for our users\u2019 to try them! We keep moving closer to our vision of making improved health accessible to all, working day by day on our mission of translating cutting-edge nutritional science and tech into simple, everyday solutions. \n\nThe Food Tracker and Nutrition Scores are already available to all our English users, but the Home screen updates are currently only available in the English iOS version of the app. More languages (French, German, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish) and Android are coming soon! \n\n\ud83d\udc49 https://lnkd.in/dCtF9UwP",

Now all they need to do is eat, log, and learn from the food feedback they get.\nLogging food with SIMPLE is now easier and more intuitive. Instead of scrolling a food database, users can just type in what they ate, snap a photo of their meal, or describe it using their voice.\nOnce a user has logged their food, it\u2019s analyzed by the Nutrition Scores system which the Simple App science team has infused with #nutrition knowledge and designed to reflect well-established nutrition guidelines. The user then gets a (judgment-free) Nutrition Score of Low, Fair, Good, or Optimal which shows the overall nutrition quality of their meal.\nThat\u2019s a game-changer, right there \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb:\n\nAny time a user feels stuck on what to do next, one glance at their Simple Home screen will point them in the right direction of what to do today, and where they\u2019re at with their overall day\u2019s Nutrition Score and within their fasting schedule.\nThese outstanding new features are another brick in the wall of\u00a0Simple App\u2019s vision to make improved health accessible to all.

Incorporating AI into our already-smart #tech is changing the game for how we support our users, and we\u2019re super excited to share some new features with you today!\u00a0 \n\n\ud83c\udf4f\ud83e\udd50\ud83c\udf45 INTRODUCING \u2026 our new and improved Food Tracker \n\nLogging food with SIMPLE is now easier, more intuitive, and quick as a flash. Instead of scrolling a food database, users can just type in what they ate, snap a photo of their meal, or describe it using their voice. \n\nWe\u2019re stoked with this update. But what comes next is even BETTER. \n\n\ud83d\udfe2\ud83d\udfe0\ud83d\udfe1 INTRODUCING \u2026 our new Nutrition Scores and food feedback \n\nOnce a user has logged their food, it\u2019s analyzed by our algorithm, which has been designed alongside our in-house science team to reflect well-established #nutrition guidelines. Each food is assessed in terms of nutritional factors that influence weight and health to give the user a Nutrition Score of Low, Fair, Good, or Optimal. This shows the overall nutritional quality of their meal. They can also see a daily Score, which is the average of all meal Scores logged that day. \n\nWe designed Nutrition Scores based on our belief that no food is either \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad.\u201d These Scores don\u2019t judge our users or their food choices. They\u2019re designed to guide \u2014 not guilt \u2014 them toward a healthier, more balanced diet over time, bringing their goals even more within reach. #nutritionmatters\n\n\ud83d\udcf2 INTRODUCING \u2026 our redesigned Home screen that guides users on what to do today, saving them time, and confusion, and smoothing out the bumpy road of building new habits. \n\nNow when users tap open their app, they have these key features in one place:\u00a0\n\ud83d\udcf2 the day\u2019s average Nutrition Score and logged meals\n\ud83d\udcf2 a button to log new meals (and edit previously logged meals)\n\ud83d\udcf2 where they are in their eating or fasting window\n\ud83d\udcf2 buttons to start or stop their fast or change their daily intermittent fasting schedule \n\n\ud83e\udd51 DON\u2019T FORGET \u2026 Avo, our recently launched AI-powered nutrition chatbot\n\nA final shout-out to Avo, who\u2019s on hand 24/7 to answer your wellness questions! Avo\u2019s now living its best life in the SIMPLE app, helping users zhuzh up their meals, feel more relaxed when stress-eating flares up, and stay motivated on their weight loss journey.\n\nLaunching these brand-new features in our SIMPLE app feels like Christmas Day: we can\u2019t wait for our users\u2019 to try them! We keep moving closer to our vision of making improved health accessible to all, working day by day on our mission of translating cutting-edge nutritional science and tech into simple, everyday solutions. \n\nThe Food Tracker and Nutrition Scores are already available to all our English users, but the Home screen updates are currently only available in the English iOS version of the app. More languages (French, German, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish) and Android are coming soon! \n\n\ud83d\udc49 https://lnkd.in/dCtF9UwP",

But her career journey has been one of embracing change and seizing new opportunities.\n\n\ud83d\udd04 Switching Sectors: Georgia transitioned from a traditional law firm to the private banking sector before ultimately landing in the tech industry. This decision wasn't easy, but it was fueled by her attraction to innovation and entrepreneurial spirit.\n\n\ud83d\udd2e Future-focused: Georgia is optimistic about the tech sector's future, especially after its resilience during challenging times. Being in-house counsel in tech is not just about legalities; it's about understanding the big picture and adapting to constant changes in business and global contexts.\n\n\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Skill Set: Beyond legal advice, in-house roles require project management skills and effective communication with various stakeholders\u2014from management to marketing.\n\n\ud83e\udd16 Tech-Savvy Legal Operations: At Palta, Georgia highlights the increasing role of generative AI tools and automated processes in legal operations. She advocates for lawyers to be educated in legal technology as the industry evolves.\n\n\ud83c\udf0d Staying Informed: With the fast-paced nature of tech, Georgia stresses the importance of staying updated from trusted sources on both local and global scales.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 \"You can observe the next generation, but it is way more fascinating to be a part of it!\" - Georgia Kampanelli\n\nRead the full interview at\u00a0https://bitly.ws/TFBZ\n\n#LegalCounsel #CareerJourney #Innovation #ChangeManagement #LegalTech",

It reminded me that building a product with soul goes beyond technology \u2014 it requires a deep understanding of people's needs and a commitment to creating meaningful impact in their lives.\n\nThank you Palta for organising such a great event!\n\n#healthtech #innovation #startup #entrepreneurship #founders",

But her career journey has been one of embracing change and seizing new opportunities.\n\n\ud83d\udd04 Switching Sectors: Georgia transitioned from a traditional law firm to the private banking sector before ultimately landing in the tech industry. This decision wasn't easy, but it was fueled by her attraction to innovation and entrepreneurial spirit.\n\n\ud83d\udd2e Future-focused: Georgia is optimistic about the tech sector's future, especially after its resilience during challenging times. Being in-house counsel in tech is not just about legalities; it's about understanding the big picture and adapting to constant changes in business and global contexts.\n\n\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Skill Set: Beyond legal advice, in-house roles require project management skills and effective communication with various stakeholders\u2014from management to marketing.\n\n\ud83e\udd16 Tech-Savvy Legal Operations: At Palta, Georgia highlights the increasing role of generative AI tools and automated processes in legal operations. She advocates for lawyers to be educated in legal technology as the industry evolves.\n\n\ud83c\udf0d Staying Informed: With the fast-paced nature of tech, Georgia stresses the importance of staying updated from trusted sources on both local and global scales.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 \"You can observe the next generation, but it is way more fascinating to be a part of it!\" - Georgia Kampanelli\n\nRead the full interview at\u00a0https://bitly.ws/TFBZ\n\n#LegalCounsel #CareerJourney #Innovation #ChangeManagement #LegalTech",

With Flo for Partners, we are expanding our commitment to revolutionizing women's health by offering science-backed insights to couples seeking to improve their sex life, increase their chances of conceiving, or share their pregnancy journey. \n\nOur recent survey of nearly 2k American men found that over half feel that their sex education during adolescence was insufficient, and one-third report that insufficient sex education has led to unrealistic expectations and difficulty in communicating about sex. \n\nFlo for Partners addresses this knowledge gap head-on by providing medical insights, authored and vetted by Flo's team of over 120+ medical experts, and proactive tips to the partner's app. These insights and tips aim to enhance the partner's ability to support and understand their female partner, both physically and emotionally. \n\nAs of today, Flo for Partners is available on both iOS and Android platforms.

It was an evening defined by quality, exclusivity, and the forward-looking vision of our guest speaker, Yuri Gurski.\n\nYuri, the CEO and Board Member at Palta and the Founder and President at Flo Health Inc., graced us with his presence and shared his insights. Palta, a multi-product technology company, boasts over 60 million monthly active users, and Flo Health Inc., their flagship product, is the #1 health app in the world, with over 300 million downloads.\n\nDuring his talk, Yuri delved into the paradigm shift in the business landscape driven by AI and empathetic AI-driven products. He painted a picture of how these innovations will reshape productivity, health, and even dating in the coming years.\n\nBut what truly set this event apart was Yuri's emphasis on outliers - those who defy conventional success and operate at the extreme edges of possibility. He expressed a keen interest in those who possess exceptional intelligence and are ready to drive change in their respective fields.\n\nYuri also shed light on how Palta collaborates with and supports such outliers to lead the business shift trend in their domains. With more than a dozen new product ideas on the horizon, Palta's potential knows no bounds.\n\nThe evening was a gathering for individuals passionate about innovation, AI technology, and shaping the future. It featured a talk, a Q&A session, and networking opportunities with like-minded founders and tech professionals.\n\nThis event marked a milestone in our \"Create What You Wish Existed\" series, which has previously hosted founders like Sam Altman, Nik Storonsky, Michael Acton Smith, and more. The quest for knowledge and the drive to create a brighter future unite us all.\n\nThank you to everyone who joined us for this evening of learning and networking. Stay tuned for more events that push the boundaries of innovation!\n\n#Innovation #AI #Tech #CreateWhatYouWishExisted #Palta #Yuri #Outliers #FutureShapers #Networking #LondonEvents #Flo",

But her career journey has been one of embracing change and seizing new opportunities.\n\n\ud83d\udd04 Switching Sectors: Georgia transitioned from a traditional law firm to the private banking sector before ultimately landing in the tech industry. This decision wasn't easy, but it was fueled by her attraction to innovation and entrepreneurial spirit.\n\n\ud83d\udd2e Future-focused: Georgia is optimistic about the tech sector's future, especially after its resilience during challenging times. Being in-house counsel in tech is not just about legalities; it's about understanding the big picture and adapting to constant changes in business and global contexts.\n\n\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Skill Set: Beyond legal advice, in-house roles require project management skills and effective communication with various stakeholders\u2014from management to marketing.\n\n\ud83e\udd16 Tech-Savvy Legal Operations: At Palta, Georgia highlights the increasing role of generative AI tools and automated processes in legal operations. She advocates for lawyers to be educated in legal technology as the industry evolves.\n\n\ud83c\udf0d Staying Informed: With the fast-paced nature of tech, Georgia stresses the importance of staying updated from trusted sources on both local and global scales.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 \"You can observe the next generation, but it is way more fascinating to be a part of it!\" - Georgia Kampanelli\n\nRead the full interview at\u00a0https://bitly.ws/TFBZ\n\n#LegalCounsel #CareerJourney #Innovation #ChangeManagement #LegalTech",

With Flo for Partners, we are expanding our commitment to revolutionizing women's health by offering science-backed insights to couples seeking to improve their sex life, increase their chances of conceiving, or share their pregnancy journey. \n\nOur recent survey of nearly 2k American men found that over half feel that their sex education during adolescence was insufficient, and one-third report that insufficient sex education has led to unrealistic expectations and difficulty in communicating about sex. \n\nFlo for Partners addresses this knowledge gap head-on by providing medical insights, authored and vetted by Flo's team of over 120+ medical experts, and proactive tips to the partner's app. These insights and tips aim to enhance the partner's ability to support and understand their female partner, both physically and emotionally. \n\nAs of today, Flo for Partners is available on both iOS and Android platforms.

With Flo for Partners, we are expanding our commitment to revolutionizing women's health by offering science-backed insights to couples seeking to improve their sex life, increase their chances of conceiving, or share their pregnancy journey. \n\nOur recent survey of nearly 2k American men found that over half feel that their sex education during adolescence was insufficient, and one-third report that insufficient sex education has led to unrealistic expectations and difficulty in communicating about sex. \n\nFlo for Partners addresses this knowledge gap head-on by providing medical insights, authored and vetted by Flo's team of over 120+ medical experts, and proactive tips to the partner's app. These insights and tips aim to enhance the partner's ability to support and understand their female partner, both physically and emotionally. \n\nAs of today, Flo for Partners is available on both iOS and Android platforms.

            "description": "Last night in London, we had the privilege of hosting an event as part of the \"Create What You Wish Existed\" series. It was an evening defined by quality, exclusivity, and the forward-looking vision of our guest speaker, Yuri Gurski.\n\nYuri, the CEO and Board Member at Palta and the Founder and President at Flo Health Inc., graced us with his presence and shared his insights. Palta, a multi-product technology company, boasts over 60 million monthly active users, and Flo Health Inc., their flagship product, is the #1 health app in the world, with over 300 million downloads.\n\nDuring his talk, Yuri delved into the paradigm shift in the business landscape driven by AI and empathetic AI-driven products. He painted a picture of how these innovations will reshape productivity, health, and even dating in the coming years.\n\nBut what truly set this event apart was Yuri's emphasis on outliers - those who defy conventional success and operate at the extreme edges of possibility. He expressed a keen interest in those who possess exceptional intelligence and are ready to drive change in their respective fields.\n\nYuri also shed light on how Palta collaborates with and supports such outliers to lead the business shift trend in their domains. With more than a dozen new product ideas on the horizon, Palta's potential knows no bounds.\n\nThe evening was a gathering for individuals passionate about innovation, AI technology, and shaping the future. It featured a talk, a Q&A session, and networking opportunities with like-minded founders and tech professionals.\n\nThis event marked a milestone in our \"Create What You Wish Existed\" series, which has previously hosted founders like Sam Altman, Nik Storonsky, Michael Acton Smith, and more. The quest for knowledge and the drive to create a brighter future unite us all.\n\nThank you to everyone who joined us for this evening of learning and networking. Stay tuned for more events that push the boundaries of innovation!\n\n#Innovation #AI #Tech #CreateWhatYouWishExisted #Palta #Yuri #Outliers #FutureShapers #Networking #LondonEvents #Flo",

But her career journey has been one of embracing change and seizing new opportunities.\n\n\ud83d\udd04 Switching Sectors: Georgia transitioned from a traditional law firm to the private banking sector before ultimately landing in the tech industry. This decision wasn't easy, but it was fueled by her attraction to innovation and entrepreneurial spirit.\n\n\ud83d\udd2e Future-focused: Georgia is optimistic about the tech sector's future, especially after its resilience during challenging times. Being in-house counsel in tech is not just about legalities; it's about understanding the big picture and adapting to constant changes in business and global contexts.\n\n\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Skill Set: Beyond legal advice, in-house roles require project management skills and effective communication with various stakeholders\u2014from management to marketing.\n\n\ud83e\udd16 Tech-Savvy Legal Operations: At Palta, Georgia highlights the increasing role of generative AI tools and automated processes in legal operations. She advocates for lawyers to be educated in legal technology as the industry evolves.\n\n\ud83c\udf0d Staying Informed: With the fast-paced nature of tech, Georgia stresses the importance of staying updated from trusted sources on both local and global scales.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 \"You can observe the next generation, but it is way more fascinating to be a part of it!\" - Georgia Kampanelli\n\nRead the full interview at\u00a0https://bitly.ws/TFBZ\n\n#LegalCounsel #CareerJourney #Innovation #ChangeManagement #LegalTech",

Now all they need to do is eat, log, and learn from the food feedback they get.\nLogging food with SIMPLE is now easier and more intuitive. Instead of scrolling a food database, users can just type in what they ate, snap a photo of their meal, or describe it using their voice.\nOnce a user has logged their food, it\u2019s analyzed by the Nutrition Scores system which the Simple App science team has infused with #nutrition knowledge and designed to reflect well-established nutrition guidelines. The user then gets a (judgment-free) Nutrition Score of Low, Fair, Good, or Optimal which shows the overall nutrition quality of their meal.\nThat\u2019s a game-changer, right there \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb:\n\nAny time a user feels stuck on what to do next, one glance at their Simple Home screen will point them in the right direction of what to do today, and where they\u2019re at with their overall day\u2019s Nutrition Score and within their fasting schedule.\nThese outstanding new features are another brick in the wall of\u00a0Simple App\u2019s vision to make improved health accessible to all.

Incorporating AI into our already-smart #tech is changing the game for how we support our users, and we\u2019re super excited to share some new features with you today!\u00a0 \n\n\ud83c\udf4f\ud83e\udd50\ud83c\udf45 INTRODUCING \u2026 our new and improved Food Tracker \n\nLogging food with SIMPLE is now easier, more intuitive, and quick as a flash. Instead of scrolling a food database, users can just type in what they ate, snap a photo of their meal, or describe it using their voice. \n\nWe\u2019re stoked with this update. But what comes next is even BETTER. \n\n\ud83d\udfe2\ud83d\udfe0\ud83d\udfe1 INTRODUCING \u2026 our new Nutrition Scores and food feedback \n\nOnce a user has logged their food, it\u2019s analyzed by our algorithm, which has been designed alongside our in-house science team to reflect well-established #nutrition guidelines. Each food is assessed in terms of nutritional factors that influence weight and health to give the user a Nutrition Score of Low, Fair, Good, or Optimal. This shows the overall nutritional quality of their meal. They can also see a daily Score, which is the average of all meal Scores logged that day. \n\nWe designed Nutrition Scores based on our belief that no food is either \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad.\u201d These Scores don\u2019t judge our users or their food choices. They\u2019re designed to guide \u2014 not guilt \u2014 them toward a healthier, more balanced diet over time, bringing their goals even more within reach. #nutritionmatters\n\n\ud83d\udcf2 INTRODUCING \u2026 our redesigned Home screen that guides users on what to do today, saving them time, and confusion, and smoothing out the bumpy road of building new habits. \n\nNow when users tap open their app, they have these key features in one place:\u00a0\n\ud83d\udcf2 the day\u2019s average Nutrition Score and logged meals\n\ud83d\udcf2 a button to log new meals (and edit previously logged meals)\n\ud83d\udcf2 where they are in their eating or fasting window\n\ud83d\udcf2 buttons to start or stop their fast or change their daily intermittent fasting schedule \n\n\ud83e\udd51 DON\u2019T FORGET \u2026 Avo, our recently launched AI-powered nutrition chatbot\n\nA final shout-out to Avo, who\u2019s on hand 24/7 to answer your wellness questions! Avo\u2019s now living its best life in the SIMPLE app, helping users zhuzh up their meals, feel more relaxed when stress-eating flares up, and stay motivated on their weight loss journey.\n\nLaunching these brand-new features in our SIMPLE app feels like Christmas Day: we can\u2019t wait for our users\u2019 to try them! We keep moving closer to our vision of making improved health accessible to all, working day by day on our mission of translating cutting-edge nutritional science and tech into simple, everyday solutions. \n\nThe Food Tracker and Nutrition Scores are already available to all our English users, but the Home screen updates are currently only available in the English iOS version of the app. More languages (French, German, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish) and Android are coming soon! \n\n\ud83d\udc49 https://lnkd.in/dCtF9UwP",

            "description": "Today marks the official launch of Flo for Partners, the #1 most requested feature by Flo\u2019s 58 million monthly active users.\n\nAs the world's leading women's health app, Flo\u2019s mission is to create a better future for female health. With Flo for Partners, we are expanding our commitment to revolutionizing women's health by offering science-backed insights to couples seeking to improve their sex life, increase their chances of conceiving, or share their pregnancy journey. \n\nOur recent survey of nearly 2k American men found that over half feel that their sex education during adolescence was insufficient, and one-third report that insufficient sex education has led to unrealistic expectations and difficulty in communicating about sex. \n\nFlo for Partners addresses this knowledge gap head-on by providing medical insights, authored and vetted by Flo's team of over 120+ medical experts, and proactive tips to the partner's app. These insights and tips aim to enhance the partner's ability to support and understand their female partner, both physically and emotionally. \n\nAs of today, Flo for Partners is available on both iOS and Android platforms.

It was an evening defined by quality, exclusivity, and the forward-looking vision of our guest speaker, Yuri Gurski.\n\nYuri, the CEO and Board Member at Palta and the Founder and President at Flo Health Inc., graced us with his presence and shared his insights. Palta, a multi-product technology company, boasts over 60 million monthly active users, and Flo Health Inc., their flagship product, is the #1 health app in the world, with over 300 million downloads.\n\nDuring his talk, Yuri delved into the paradigm shift in the business landscape driven by AI and empathetic AI-driven products. He painted a picture of how these innovations will reshape productivity, health, and even dating in the coming years.\n\nBut what truly set this event apart was Yuri's emphasis on outliers - those who defy conventional success and operate at the extreme edges of possibility. He expressed a keen interest in those who possess exceptional intelligence and are ready to drive change in their respective fields.\n\nYuri also shed light on how Palta collaborates with and supports such outliers to lead the business shift trend in their domains. With more than a dozen new product ideas on the horizon, Palta's potential knows no bounds.\n\nThe evening was a gathering for individuals passionate about innovation, AI technology, and shaping the future. It featured a talk, a Q&A session, and networking opportunities with like-minded founders and tech professionals.\n\nThis event marked a milestone in our \"Create What You Wish Existed\" series, which has previously hosted founders like Sam Altman, Nik Storonsky, Michael Acton Smith, and more. The quest for knowledge and the drive to create a brighter future unite us all.\n\nThank you to everyone who joined us for this evening of learning and networking. Stay tuned for more events that push the boundaries of innovation!\n\n#Innovation #AI #Tech #CreateWhatYouWishExisted #Palta #Yuri #Outliers #FutureShapers #Networking #LondonEvents #Flo",

But her career journey has been one of embracing change and seizing new opportunities.\n\n\ud83d\udd04 Switching Sectors: Georgia transitioned from a traditional law firm to the private banking sector before ultimately landing in the tech industry. This decision wasn't easy, but it was fueled by her attraction to innovation and entrepreneurial spirit.\n\n\ud83d\udd2e Future-focused: Georgia is optimistic about the tech sector's future, especially after its resilience during challenging times. Being in-house counsel in tech is not just about legalities; it's about understanding the big picture and adapting to constant changes in business and global contexts.\n\n\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Skill Set: Beyond legal advice, in-house roles require project management skills and effective communication with various stakeholders\u2014from management to marketing.\n\n\ud83e\udd16 Tech-Savvy Legal Operations: At Palta, Georgia highlights the increasing role of generative AI tools and automated processes in legal operations. She advocates for lawyers to be educated in legal technology as the industry evolves.\n\n\ud83c\udf0d Staying Informed: With the fast-paced nature of tech, Georgia stresses the importance of staying updated from trusted sources on both local and global scales.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 \"You can observe the next generation, but it is way more fascinating to be a part of it!\" - Georgia Kampanelli\n\nRead the full interview at\u00a0https://bitly.ws/TFBZ\n\n#LegalCounsel #CareerJourney #Innovation #ChangeManagement #LegalTech",

Now all they need to do is eat, log, and learn from the food feedback they get.\nLogging food with SIMPLE is now easier and more intuitive. Instead of scrolling a food database, users can just type in what they ate, snap a photo of their meal, or describe it using their voice.\nOnce a user has logged their food, it\u2019s analyzed by the Nutrition Scores system which the Simple App science team has infused with #nutrition knowledge and designed to reflect well-established nutrition guidelines. The user then gets a (judgment-free) Nutrition Score of Low, Fair, Good, or Optimal which shows the overall nutrition quality of their meal.\nThat\u2019s a game-changer, right there \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb:\n\nAny time a user feels stuck on what to do next, one glance at their Simple Home screen will point them in the right direction of what to do today, and where they\u2019re at with their overall day\u2019s Nutrition Score and within their fasting schedule.\nThese outstanding new features are another brick in the wall of\u00a0Simple App\u2019s vision to make improved health accessible to all.

Incorporating AI into our already-smart #tech is changing the game for how we support our users, and we\u2019re super excited to share some new features with you today!\u00a0 \n\n\ud83c\udf4f\ud83e\udd50\ud83c\udf45 INTRODUCING \u2026 our new and improved Food Tracker \n\nLogging food with SIMPLE is now easier, more intuitive, and quick as a flash. Instead of scrolling a food database, users can just type in what they ate, snap a photo of their meal, or describe it using their voice. \n\nWe\u2019re stoked with this update. But what comes next is even BETTER. \n\n\ud83d\udfe2\ud83d\udfe0\ud83d\udfe1 INTRODUCING \u2026 our new Nutrition Scores and food feedback \n\nOnce a user has logged their food, it\u2019s analyzed by our algorithm, which has been designed alongside our in-house science team to reflect well-established #nutrition guidelines. Each food is assessed in terms of nutritional factors that influence weight and health to give the user a Nutrition Score of Low, Fair, Good, or Optimal. This shows the overall nutritional quality of their meal. They can also see a daily Score, which is the average of all meal Scores logged that day. \n\nWe designed Nutrition Scores based on our belief that no food is either \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad.\u201d These Scores don\u2019t judge our users or their food choices. They\u2019re designed to guide \u2014 not guilt \u2014 them toward a healthier, more balanced diet over time, bringing their goals even more within reach. #nutritionmatters\n\n\ud83d\udcf2 INTRODUCING \u2026 our redesigned Home screen that guides users on what to do today, saving them time, and confusion, and smoothing out the bumpy road of building new habits. \n\nNow when users tap open their app, they have these key features in one place:\u00a0\n\ud83d\udcf2 the day\u2019s average Nutrition Score and logged meals\n\ud83d\udcf2 a button to log new meals (and edit previously logged meals)\n\ud83d\udcf2 where they are in their eating or fasting window\n\ud83d\udcf2 buttons to start or stop their fast or change their daily intermittent fasting schedule \n\n\ud83e\udd51 DON\u2019T FORGET \u2026 Avo, our recently launched AI-powered nutrition chatbot\n\nA final shout-out to Avo, who\u2019s on hand 24/7 to answer your wellness questions! Avo\u2019s now living its best life in the SIMPLE app, helping users zhuzh up their meals, feel more relaxed when stress-eating flares up, and stay motivated on their weight loss journey.\n\nLaunching these brand-new features in our SIMPLE app feels like Christmas Day: we can\u2019t wait for our users\u2019 to try them! We keep moving closer to our vision of making improved health accessible to all, working day by day on our mission of translating cutting-edge nutritional science and tech into simple, everyday solutions. \n\nThe Food Tracker and Nutrition Scores are already available to all our English users, but the Home screen updates are currently only available in the English iOS version of the app. More languages (French, German, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish) and Android are coming soon! \n\n\ud83d\udc49 https://lnkd.in/dCtF9UwP",

            "description": "Come with us as we rub our crystal ball and explore 5 wellness trends for 2024, predicted by our Chief Nutrition Officer Ro Huntriss and the Science team at SIMPLE. Check out our blog for more. \n\n\u2696\ufe0f 1. LOOKING BEYOND THE SCALE \u2696\ufe0f\u00a0\nIn 2024, it\u2019s high time we put body weight and BMI into context and decentered weight loss as the main purpose of living a healthy lifestyle. We\u2019re seeing restrictive diets wane in popularity, and a growing desire for sustainable habits that support our overall well-being. \n\n\ud83d\udc9c Our 2024 prediction:\u00a0\nWe\u2019ll embrace health as a multi-faceted mix of factors and move further away from chasing the scale number as if it\u2019s the only thing that matters. As staunch members of #TeamSelfCare, we couldn\u2019t be more excited by this shift. \n\n\ud83c\udf0e 2. EATING FOR PLANET HEALTH \ud83c\udf0e\nA recent research review found that ultra-processed foods (UPFs) contribute more than other food groups to greenhouse gas emissions and account for 36\u201345% of total diet-related biodiversity loss. It\u2019s increasingly clear that eating in a more environmentally-sustainable way means eating more plants and fewer UPFS. \n\n\ud83d\udc9c Our 2024 prediction:\u00a0\nWe\u2019ll find new ways of creating healthy, environmentally sustainable diets.\n\n\ud83e\ude78 3. EMBRACING PERIOD POSITIVITY \ud83e\ude78\u00a0\nConversations around periods and menstrual health are becoming more mainstream, putting menstrual health firmly on the global agenda, and driving creative solutions in period products, clothing, and self-care.\n\n\ud83d\udc9c Our 2024 prediction:\u00a0\nEmpowering women, girls, and all those who menstruate to understand, openly discuss, and feel good about their bodies\u2019 needs is something we wholeheartedly support, and we\u2019re confident our colleagues over at the Flo app will be leading the charge! \n\n\ud83d\ude0c 4. SOOTHING STRESS WITH SELF-CARE \ud83d\ude0c\nWith the pandemic only just in the rear view mirror; 2023\u2019s heavy layoffs, job insecurity, and financial pressures; plus kickback from our constantly-connected digital lives, our mental health is under mounting pressure. \n\nIn response, we\u2019re taking more control. An Instagram survey found that one of Gen Z\u2019s top priorities in 2024 is staying healthy, and the Global Wellness Institute saying we\u2019re investing more money into self-care than ever.\n\n\ud83d\udc9c Our 2024 prediction:\u00a0\nWe\u2019ll tackle our ever-growing list of stressors with increasing determination. \n\n\ud83e\udd16 5. HARNESSING AI FOR HEALTH \ud83e\udd16\u00a0\nBy analyzing real-time data to optimize our experience, AI can help us have more satisfying and productive practices across many areas of health \u2014 meditation, fitness, nutrition, stress, sleep, etc. \u2014 without the hefty price tag often associated with 1-2-1 coaching. \n\n\ud83d\udc9c Our 2024 prediction:\u00a0\nWe\u2019ll see AI being used more for personalized support and coaching. At SIMPLE, we\u2019ve got big plans for Avo, our wellness assistant! \n\nhttps://lnkd.in/dKqfHguf",

While 70% of women in India report menstrual health issues, a concerning 82% of girls in Malawi reported having no knowledge of menstruation before their first period.\n\nAs of today:\n\ud83d\udccb1 billion women will now have access to Flo Premium completely free\n\ud83c\udf0d 44 new countries can now benefit, including India, Indonesia, and Nigeria\n\ud83d\udc9d10 million+ women worldwide are using Flo Premium for free today\n\nWe look forward to a brighter future, one with better health and fertility outcomes for women worldwide.\n\nTo every existing paying Premium member \u2014 thank you.

With Flo for Partners, we are expanding our commitment to revolutionizing women's health by offering science-backed insights to couples seeking to improve their sex life, increase their chances of conceiving, or share their pregnancy journey. \n\nOur recent survey of nearly 2k American men found that over half feel that their sex education during adolescence was insufficient, and one-third report that insufficient sex education has led to unrealistic expectations and difficulty in communicating about sex. \n\nFlo for Partners addresses this knowledge gap head-on by providing medical insights, authored and vetted by Flo's team of over 120+ medical experts, and proactive tips to the partner's app. These insights and tips aim to enhance the partner's ability to support and understand their female partner, both physically and emotionally. \n\nAs of today, Flo for Partners is available on both iOS and Android platforms.

It was an evening defined by quality, exclusivity, and the forward-looking vision of our guest speaker, Yuri Gurski.\n\nYuri, the CEO and Board Member at Palta and the Founder and President at Flo Health Inc., graced us with his presence and shared his insights. Palta, a multi-product technology company, boasts over 60 million monthly active users, and Flo Health Inc., their flagship product, is the #1 health app in the world, with over 300 million downloads.\n\nDuring his talk, Yuri delved into the paradigm shift in the business landscape driven by AI and empathetic AI-driven products. He painted a picture of how these innovations will reshape productivity, health, and even dating in the coming years.\n\nBut what truly set this event apart was Yuri's emphasis on outliers - those who defy conventional success and operate at the extreme edges of possibility. He expressed a keen interest in those who possess exceptional intelligence and are ready to drive change in their respective fields.\n\nYuri also shed light on how Palta collaborates with and supports such outliers to lead the business shift trend in their domains. With more than a dozen new product ideas on the horizon, Palta's potential knows no bounds.\n\nThe evening was a gathering for individuals passionate about innovation, AI technology, and shaping the future. It featured a talk, a Q&A session, and networking opportunities with like-minded founders and tech professionals.\n\nThis event marked a milestone in our \"Create What You Wish Existed\" series, which has previously hosted founders like Sam Altman, Nik Storonsky, Michael Acton Smith, and more. The quest for knowledge and the drive to create a brighter future unite us all.\n\nThank you to everyone who joined us for this evening of learning and networking. Stay tuned for more events that push the boundaries of innovation!\n\n#Innovation #AI #Tech #CreateWhatYouWishExisted #Palta #Yuri #Outliers #FutureShapers #Networking #LondonEvents #Flo",

            "description": "Meet Georgia Kampanelli, Legal Counsel at Palta, whom Gold Magazine recently interviewed.\n\n\ud83d\udd35 She didn't initially envision herself working in a tech company. But her career journey has been one of embracing change and seizing new opportunities.\n\n\ud83d\udd04 Switching Sectors: Georgia transitioned from a traditional law firm to the private banking sector before ultimately landing in the tech industry. This decision wasn't easy, but it was fueled by her attraction to innovation and entrepreneurial spirit.\n\n\ud83d\udd2e Future-focused: Georgia is optimistic about the tech sector's future, especially after its resilience during challenging times. Being in-house counsel in tech is not just about legalities; it's about understanding the big picture and adapting to constant changes in business and global contexts.\n\n\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Skill Set: Beyond legal advice, in-house roles require project management skills and effective communication with various stakeholders\u2014from management to marketing.\n\n\ud83e\udd16 Tech-Savvy Legal Operations: At Palta, Georgia highlights the increasing role of generative AI tools and automated processes in legal operations. She advocates for lawyers to be educated in legal technology as the industry evolves.\n\n\ud83c\udf0d Staying Informed: With the fast-paced nature of tech, Georgia stresses the importance of staying updated from trusted sources on both local and global scales.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 \"You can observe the next generation, but it is way more fascinating to be a part of it!\" - Georgia Kampanelli\n\nRead the full interview at\u00a0https://bitly.ws/TFBZ\n\n#LegalCounsel #CareerJourney #Innovation #ChangeManagement #LegalTech",

            "description": "Another epic update from the team at\u00a0Simple App, who\u2019ve been hard at work at the coalface of cutting-edge tech, designing an updated Food Tracker, a system that Scores their users\u2019 meals\u2019 nutrient value, AND an updated Home screen \u2014 talk about busy!\nThese new features will remove a lot of confusion and frustration from users\u2019 lives \u2014 no more scratching their heads wondering if a meal was helpful or healthy for their goals. Now all they need to do is eat, log, and learn from the food feedback they get.\nLogging food with SIMPLE is now easier and more intuitive. Instead of scrolling a food database, users can just type in what they ate, snap a photo of their meal, or describe it using their voice.\nOnce a user has logged their food, it\u2019s analyzed by the Nutrition Scores system which the Simple App science team has infused with #nutrition knowledge and designed to reflect well-established nutrition guidelines. The user then gets a (judgment-free) Nutrition Score of Low, Fair, Good, or Optimal which shows the overall nutrition quality of their meal.\nThat\u2019s a game-changer, right there \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb:\n\nAny time a user feels stuck on what to do next, one glance at their Simple Home screen will point them in the right direction of what to do today, and where they\u2019re at with their overall day\u2019s Nutrition Score and within their fasting schedule.\nThese outstanding new features are another brick in the wall of\u00a0Simple App\u2019s vision to make improved health accessible to all. Learn more about them here: \ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffb\nNice work team!!\n\n\n#ai #nutrition #objectives #healthylifestyle #productdevelopment #productdesign #userexperience #wellness",

Incorporating AI into our already-smart #tech is changing the game for how we support our users, and we\u2019re super excited to share some new features with you today!\u00a0 \n\n\ud83c\udf4f\ud83e\udd50\ud83c\udf45 INTRODUCING \u2026 our new and improved Food Tracker \n\nLogging food with SIMPLE is now easier, more intuitive, and quick as a flash. Instead of scrolling a food database, users can just type in what they ate, snap a photo of their meal, or describe it using their voice. \n\nWe\u2019re stoked with this update. But what comes next is even BETTER. \n\n\ud83d\udfe2\ud83d\udfe0\ud83d\udfe1 INTRODUCING \u2026 our new Nutrition Scores and food feedback \n\nOnce a user has logged their food, it\u2019s analyzed by our algorithm, which has been designed alongside our in-house science team to reflect well-established #nutrition guidelines. Each food is assessed in terms of nutritional factors that influence weight and health to give the user a Nutrition Score of Low, Fair, Good, or Optimal. This shows the overall nutritional quality of their meal. They can also see a daily Score, which is the average of all meal Scores logged that day. \n\nWe designed Nutrition Scores based on our belief that no food is either \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad.\u201d These Scores don\u2019t judge our users or their food choices. They\u2019re designed to guide \u2014 not guilt \u2014 them toward a healthier, more balanced diet over time, bringing their goals even more within reach. #nutritionmatters\n\n\ud83d\udcf2 INTRODUCING \u2026 our redesigned Home screen that guides users on what to do today, saving them time, and confusion, and smoothing out the bumpy road of building new habits. \n\nNow when users tap open their app, they have these key features in one place:\u00a0\n\ud83d\udcf2 the day\u2019s average Nutrition Score and logged meals\n\ud83d\udcf2 a button to log new meals (and edit previously logged meals)\n\ud83d\udcf2 where they are in their eating or fasting window\n\ud83d\udcf2 buttons to start or stop their fast or change their daily intermittent fasting schedule \n\n\ud83e\udd51 DON\u2019T FORGET \u2026 Avo, our recently launched AI-powered nutrition chatbot\n\nA final shout-out to Avo, who\u2019s on hand 24/7 to answer your wellness questions! Avo\u2019s now living its best life in the SIMPLE app, helping users zhuzh up their meals, feel more relaxed when stress-eating flares up, and stay motivated on their weight loss journey.\n\nLaunching these brand-new features in our SIMPLE app feels like Christmas Day: we can\u2019t wait for our users\u2019 to try them! We keep moving closer to our vision of making improved health accessible to all, working day by day on our mission of translating cutting-edge nutritional science and tech into simple, everyday solutions. \n\nThe Food Tracker and Nutrition Scores are already available to all our English users, but the Home screen updates are currently only available in the English iOS version of the app. More languages (French, German, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish) and Android are coming soon! \n\n\ud83d\udc49 https://lnkd.in/dCtF9UwP",

It is the biggest app by MAU in the Health & Fitness category worldwide.\nBased on the speed of growth of the audience, Flo's active user base will surpass the total population of the UK, the country where our headquarters is based, in several months.\u00a0\nIn the US, 1 in 6 women (13-45 yo) use Flo (our MAU in the US represents 17% of the population).\u00a0\nLast year, Flo added more than 10 M new monthly active users. Is it a significant number? A stand-alone app with 10 M MAU would be in the TOP 10 of the Health and fitness category (and more than 100,000 apps in the H&F category are available).\nAs you see from the graph, the audience growth in Flo is stable and steady. The reason: our product has very healthy retention. Users love it and have used it for years. Close\u00a0to 60% of Monthly Active Users have used Flo for over a\u00a0year. It is extremely rare for consumer-facing apps to retain users so well, especially from the Health & Fitness category.\u00a0\nAs our TAM is huge, Flo still has many years to grow. We believe that in the future, our active audience will be measured in hundreds of millions. Or a billion? Why not, if TAM allows that and the product is the best?",

            "description": "Come with us as we rub our crystal ball and explore 5 wellness trends for 2024, predicted by our Chief Nutrition Officer Ro Huntriss and the Science team at SIMPLE. Check out our blog for more. \n\n\u2696\ufe0f 1. LOOKING BEYOND THE SCALE \u2696\ufe0f\u00a0\nIn 2024, it\u2019s high time we put body weight and BMI into context and decentered weight loss as the main purpose of living a healthy lifestyle. We\u2019re seeing restrictive diets wane in popularity, and a growing desire for sustainable habits that support our overall well-being. \n\n\ud83d\udc9c Our 2024 prediction:\u00a0\nWe\u2019ll embrace health as a multi-faceted mix of factors and move further away from chasing the scale number as if it\u2019s the only thing that matters. As staunch members of #TeamSelfCare, we couldn\u2019t be more excited by this shift. \n\n\ud83c\udf0e 2. EATING FOR PLANET HEALTH \ud83c\udf0e\nA recent research review found that ultra-processed foods (UPFs) contribute more than other food groups to greenhouse gas emissions and account for 36\u201345% of total diet-related biodiversity loss. It\u2019s increasingly clear that eating in a more environmentally-sustainable way means eating more plants and fewer UPFS. \n\n\ud83d\udc9c Our 2024 prediction:\u00a0\nWe\u2019ll find new ways of creating healthy, environmentally sustainable diets.\n\n\ud83e\ude78 3. EMBRACING PERIOD POSITIVITY \ud83e\ude78\u00a0\nConversations around periods and menstrual health are becoming more mainstream, putting menstrual health firmly on the global agenda, and driving creative solutions in period products, clothing, and self-care.\n\n\ud83d\udc9c Our 2024 prediction:\u00a0\nEmpowering women, girls, and all those who menstruate to understand, openly discuss, and feel good about their bodies\u2019 needs is something we wholeheartedly support, and we\u2019re confident our colleagues over at the Flo app will be leading the charge! \n\n\ud83d\ude0c 4. SOOTHING STRESS WITH SELF-CARE \ud83d\ude0c\nWith the pandemic only just in the rear view mirror; 2023\u2019s heavy layoffs, job insecurity, and financial pressures; plus kickback from our constantly-connected digital lives, our mental health is under mounting pressure. \n\nIn response, we\u2019re taking more control. An Instagram survey found that one of Gen Z\u2019s top priorities in 2024 is staying healthy, and the Global Wellness Institute saying we\u2019re investing more money into self-care than ever.\n\n\ud83d\udc9c Our 2024 prediction:\u00a0\nWe\u2019ll tackle our ever-growing list of stressors with increasing determination. \n\n\ud83e\udd16 5. HARNESSING AI FOR HEALTH \ud83e\udd16\u00a0\nBy analyzing real-time data to optimize our experience, AI can help us have more satisfying and productive practices across many areas of health \u2014 meditation, fitness, nutrition, stress, sleep, etc. \u2014 without the hefty price tag often associated with 1-2-1 coaching. \n\n\ud83d\udc9c Our 2024 prediction:\u00a0\nWe\u2019ll see AI being used more for personalized support and coaching. At SIMPLE, we\u2019ve got big plans for Avo, our wellness assistant! \n\nhttps://lnkd.in/dKqfHguf",

            "description": "Today marks the official launch of Flo for Partners, the #1 most requested feature by Flo\u2019s 58 million monthly active users.\n\nAs the world's leading women's health app, Flo\u2019s mission is to create a better future for female health. With Flo for Partners, we are expanding our commitment to revolutionizing women's health by offering science-backed insights to couples seeking to improve their sex life, increase their chances of conceiving, or share their pregnancy journey. \n\nOur recent survey of nearly 2k American men found that over half feel that their sex education during adolescence was insufficient, and one-third report that insufficient sex education has led to unrealistic expectations and difficulty in communicating about sex. \n\nFlo for Partners addresses this knowledge gap head-on by providing medical insights, authored and vetted by Flo's team of over 120+ medical experts, and proactive tips to the partner's app. These insights and tips aim to enhance the partner's ability to support and understand their female partner, both physically and emotionally. \n\nAs of today, Flo for Partners is available on both iOS and Android platforms.

It was an evening defined by quality, exclusivity, and the forward-looking vision of our guest speaker, Yuri Gurski.\n\nYuri, the CEO and Board Member at Palta and the Founder and President at Flo Health Inc., graced us with his presence and shared his insights. Palta, a multi-product technology company, boasts over 60 million monthly active users, and Flo Health Inc., their flagship product, is the #1 health app in the world, with over 300 million downloads.\n\nDuring his talk, Yuri delved into the paradigm shift in the business landscape driven by AI and empathetic AI-driven products. He painted a picture of how these innovations will reshape productivity, health, and even dating in the coming years.\n\nBut what truly set this event apart was Yuri's emphasis on outliers - those who defy conventional success and operate at the extreme edges of possibility. He expressed a keen interest in those who possess exceptional intelligence and are ready to drive change in their respective fields.\n\nYuri also shed light on how Palta collaborates with and supports such outliers to lead the business shift trend in their domains. With more than a dozen new product ideas on the horizon, Palta's potential knows no bounds.\n\nThe evening was a gathering for individuals passionate about innovation, AI technology, and shaping the future. It featured a talk, a Q&A session, and networking opportunities with like-minded founders and tech professionals.\n\nThis event marked a milestone in our \"Create What You Wish Existed\" series, which has previously hosted founders like Sam Altman, Nik Storonsky, Michael Acton Smith, and more. The quest for knowledge and the drive to create a brighter future unite us all.\n\nThank you to everyone who joined us for this evening of learning and networking. Stay tuned for more events that push the boundaries of innovation!\n\n#Innovation #AI #Tech #CreateWhatYouWishExisted #Palta #Yuri #Outliers #FutureShapers #Networking #LondonEvents #Flo",

It is the biggest app by MAU in the Health & Fitness category worldwide.\nBased on the speed of growth of the audience, Flo's active user base will surpass the total population of the UK, the country where our headquarters is based, in several months.\u00a0\nIn the US, 1 in 6 women (13-45 yo) use Flo (our MAU in the US represents 17% of the population).\u00a0\nLast year, Flo added more than 10 M new monthly active users. Is it a significant number? A stand-alone app with 10 M MAU would be in the TOP 10 of the Health and fitness category (and more than 100,000 apps in the H&F category are available).\nAs you see from the graph, the audience growth in Flo is stable and steady. The reason: our product has very healthy retention. Users love it and have used it for years. Close\u00a0to 60% of Monthly Active Users have used Flo for over a\u00a0year. It is extremely rare for consumer-facing apps to retain users so well, especially from the Health & Fitness category.\u00a0\nAs our TAM is huge, Flo still has many years to grow. We believe that in the future, our active audience will be measured in hundreds of millions. Or a billion? Why not, if TAM allows that and the product is the best?",

            "description": "Come with us as we rub our crystal ball and explore 5 wellness trends for 2024, predicted by our Chief Nutrition Officer Ro Huntriss and the Science team at SIMPLE. Check out our blog for more. \n\n\u2696\ufe0f 1. LOOKING BEYOND THE SCALE \u2696\ufe0f\u00a0\nIn 2024, it\u2019s high time we put body weight and BMI into context and decentered weight loss as the main purpose of living a healthy lifestyle. We\u2019re seeing restrictive diets wane in popularity, and a growing desire for sustainable habits that support our overall well-being. \n\n\ud83d\udc9c Our 2024 prediction:\u00a0\nWe\u2019ll embrace health as a multi-faceted mix of factors and move further away from chasing the scale number as if it\u2019s the only thing that matters. As staunch members of #TeamSelfCare, we couldn\u2019t be more excited by this shift. \n\n\ud83c\udf0e 2. EATING FOR PLANET HEALTH \ud83c\udf0e\nA recent research review found that ultra-processed foods (UPFs) contribute more than other food groups to greenhouse gas emissions and account for 36\u201345% of total diet-related biodiversity loss. It\u2019s increasingly clear that eating in a more environmentally-sustainable way means eating more plants and fewer UPFS. \n\n\ud83d\udc9c Our 2024 prediction:\u00a0\nWe\u2019ll find new ways of creating healthy, environmentally sustainable diets.\n\n\ud83e\ude78 3. EMBRACING PERIOD POSITIVITY \ud83e\ude78\u00a0\nConversations around periods and menstrual health are becoming more mainstream, putting menstrual health firmly on the global agenda, and driving creative solutions in period products, clothing, and self-care.\n\n\ud83d\udc9c Our 2024 prediction:\u00a0\nEmpowering women, girls, and all those who menstruate to understand, openly discuss, and feel good about their bodies\u2019 needs is something we wholeheartedly support, and we\u2019re confident our colleagues over at the Flo app will be leading the charge! \n\n\ud83d\ude0c 4. SOOTHING STRESS WITH SELF-CARE \ud83d\ude0c\nWith the pandemic only just in the rear view mirror; 2023\u2019s heavy layoffs, job insecurity, and financial pressures; plus kickback from our constantly-connected digital lives, our mental health is under mounting pressure. \n\nIn response, we\u2019re taking more control. An Instagram survey found that one of Gen Z\u2019s top priorities in 2024 is staying healthy, and the Global Wellness Institute saying we\u2019re investing more money into self-care than ever.\n\n\ud83d\udc9c Our 2024 prediction:\u00a0\nWe\u2019ll tackle our ever-growing list of stressors with increasing determination. \n\n\ud83e\udd16 5. HARNESSING AI FOR HEALTH \ud83e\udd16\u00a0\nBy analyzing real-time data to optimize our experience, AI can help us have more satisfying and productive practices across many areas of health \u2014 meditation, fitness, nutrition, stress, sleep, etc. \u2014 without the hefty price tag often associated with 1-2-1 coaching. \n\n\ud83d\udc9c Our 2024 prediction:\u00a0\nWe\u2019ll see AI being used more for personalized support and coaching. At SIMPLE, we\u2019ve got big plans for Avo, our wellness assistant! \n\nhttps://lnkd.in/dKqfHguf",

While 70% of women in India report menstrual health issues, a concerning 82% of girls in Malawi reported having no knowledge of menstruation before their first period.\n\nAs of today:\n\ud83d\udccb1 billion women will now have access to Flo Premium completely free\n\ud83c\udf0d 44 new countries can now benefit, including India, Indonesia, and Nigeria\n\ud83d\udc9d10 million+ women worldwide are using Flo Premium for free today\n\nWe look forward to a brighter future, one with better health and fertility outcomes for women worldwide.\n\nTo every existing paying Premium member \u2014 thank you. It\u2019s because of you that we can make this global movement possible. \n\nFor more information, visit: https://lnkd.in/dMKq38DP",

            "description": "I love it when I\u2019m wrong about a new feature. When we launched Flo for Partners last year, I expected that it would be popular; it was the most requested Flo feature of all time! I also hoped that it would be a useful communication tool for relationships, together with helping couples conceive. But what I didn\u2019t expect was that men would have +40% higher retention rates than their partners. Given Flo is a female health app, this is staggering. What makes it even more impressive is that Flo has very, very good retention in the case of core users as well, which has made it the biggest health and fitness app in the world, with 62 million active users. We\u2019re still in the process of rolling this feature out to all languages, but there are already 11,000 partners per day installing Flo.\n\nFlo for Partners is designed to empower partners with scientific insights into their female partner's menstrual and reproductive health. What we\u2019re seeing is that male partners are so engaged in learning about their partner\u2019s menstrual cycles. Our ambition is that this leads not only to better communication between partners, but better empathy for female health in society as a whole.\n\nWomen\u2019s health is not just a women\u2019s health issue, it\u2019s a shared responsibility that benefits everyone. Here\u2019s what one user had to say about how Flo for Partners has improved his understanding of his partner and overall relationship:\n\n\u201cThe most beneficial aspect of the app on a personal level, is being given that frame of reference to how she really feels without her having to directly remind me. Whether it be more sad, more angry or frustrated, or even more loving, it builds in a whole new layer of consideration, that helps me adjust my own behavior to accommodate her needs better (ideally). With a little reminder that basically says \"hey here's how she is feeling today\" it makes it a lot easier to have empathy, and gives me the cheat codes to potentially make a positive difference in the quality of our day.\u201d - Jacob, 24",

Flo has always had a tremendously large TAM (it is the primary reason why it is the biggest Health&Fitness app in the world with\u00a065 million MAU). But the success of the partner mode makes our total addressable market MUCH MUCH bigger because of men!\n\nWe plan that the Flo Partner Mode will have content and tracking for men's health soon.\u00a0It will make this product to be one of the most significant players in the field of male health (by MAU).",

            "description": "I love it when I\u2019m wrong about a new feature. When we launched Flo for Partners last year, I expected that it would be popular; it was the most requested Flo feature of all time! I also hoped that it would be a useful communication tool for relationships, together with helping couples conceive. But what I didn\u2019t expect was that men would have +40% higher retention rates than their partners. Given Flo is a female health app, this is staggering. What makes it even more impressive is that Flo has very, very good retention in the case of core users as well, which has made it the biggest health and fitness app in the world, with 62 million active users. We\u2019re still in the process of rolling this feature out to all languages, but there are already 11,000 partners per day installing Flo.\n\nFlo for Partners is designed to empower partners with scientific insights into their female partner's menstrual and reproductive health. What we\u2019re seeing is that male partners are so engaged in learning about their partner\u2019s menstrual cycles. Our ambition is that this leads not only to better communication between partners, but better empathy for female health in society as a whole.\n\nWomen\u2019s health is not just a women\u2019s health issue, it\u2019s a shared responsibility that benefits everyone. Here\u2019s what one user had to say about how Flo for Partners has improved his understanding of his partner and overall relationship:\n\n\u201cThe most beneficial aspect of the app on a personal level, is being given that frame of reference to how she really feels without her having to directly remind me. Whether it be more sad, more angry or frustrated, or even more loving, it builds in a whole new layer of consideration, that helps me adjust my own behavior to accommodate her needs better (ideally). With a little reminder that basically says \"hey here's how she is feeling today\" it makes it a lot easier to have empathy, and gives me the cheat codes to potentially make a positive difference in the quality of our day.\u201d - Jacob, 24",

But it is already evident: the potential of\u00a0the Partner Mode is huge. Flo has always had a tremendously large TAM (it is the primary reason why it is the biggest Health&Fitness app in the world with\u00a065 million MAU). But the success of the partner mode makes our total addressable market MUCH MUCH bigger because of men!\n\nWe plan that the Flo Partner Mode will have content and tracking for men's health soon.\u00a0It will make this product to be one of the most significant players in the field of male health (by MAU).",

            "description": "I love it when I\u2019m wrong about a new feature. When we launched Flo for Partners last year, I expected that it would be popular; it was the most requested Flo feature of all time! I also hoped that it would be a useful communication tool for relationships, together with helping couples conceive. But what I didn\u2019t expect was that men would have +40% higher retention rates than their partners. Given Flo is a female health app, this is staggering. What makes it even more impressive is that Flo has very, very good retention in the case of core users as well, which has made it the biggest health and fitness app in the world, with 62 million active users. We\u2019re still in the process of rolling this feature out to all languages, but there are already 11,000 partners per day installing Flo.\n\nFlo for Partners is designed to empower partners with scientific insights into their female partner's menstrual and reproductive health. What we\u2019re seeing is that male partners are so engaged in learning about their partner\u2019s menstrual cycles. Our ambition is that this leads not only to better communication between partners, but better empathy for female health in society as a whole.\n\nWomen\u2019s health is not just a women\u2019s health issue, it\u2019s a shared responsibility that benefits everyone. Here\u2019s what one user had to say about how Flo for Partners has improved his understanding of his partner and overall relationship:\n\n\u201cThe most beneficial aspect of the app on a personal level, is being given that frame of reference to how she really feels without her having to directly remind me. Whether it be more sad, more angry or frustrated, or even more loving, it builds in a whole new layer of consideration, that helps me adjust my own behavior to accommodate her needs better (ideally). With a little reminder that basically says \"hey here's how she is feeling today\" it makes it a lot easier to have empathy, and gives me the cheat codes to potentially make a positive difference in the quality of our day.\u201d - Jacob, 24",

With this investment, Flo has reached a valuation of over $1 billion, achieving unicorn status.\n\nWe are proud to share that one in four women in the United States use Flo. It is the most downloaded app in the Health & Fitness category, and as of June 2024, it supports nearly 70 million monthly active users and close to 5 million paid subscribers. Additionally, millions of children have been born with the help of Flo.\n\nFor me, this achievement is particularly meaningful as it demonstrates that great success can be built on products that truly benefit people.\n\nI am especially happy that it was Charles F. Feeney, an American entrepreneur and philanthropist, who founded General Atlantic. He has been a uniquely influential figure with a tremendous impact on the world and Flo could not have wanted a better partner than his legacy General Atlantic.\n\nWe are confident that the past ten years, from my initial idea in an Excel sheet to becoming the world\u2019s largest health app, are just the beginning for Flo. With our new partners, we\u2019re excited to elevate Flo to new level and fulfill our mission to revolutionize women's healthy.",

Flo has always had a tremendously large TAM (it is the primary reason why it is the biggest Health&Fitness app in the world with\u00a065 million MAU). But the success of the partner mode makes our total addressable market MUCH MUCH bigger because of men!\n\nWe plan that the Flo Partner Mode will have content and tracking for men's health soon.\u00a0It will make this product to be one of the most significant players in the field of male health (by MAU).",
